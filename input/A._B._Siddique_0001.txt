Biography

My areas of research include artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and scalable data science. I am particularly interested in unsupervised learning, zero-shot learning, and conversational AI. I investigate emerging research topics in open-domain natural language interfaces and knowledge-grounded response generation, and build reliable and practical solutions that can seamlessly adapt to new unseen domains on-the-fly. Moreover, I am interested in exploring opportunities to leverage NLP and ML methods across disciplines.

My research has appeared in top venues such as WWW, SIGIR, KDD, CIKM, and VLDB.
