Description: AARON J. ELMORE ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR
ABOUT AARON

Aaron J. Elmore is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and the College of the University of Chicago. Aaron was previously a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT working with Mike Stonebraker on elastic and multitenant database systems, and Sam Madden on the DataHub project. Aaron's thesis on Elasticity Primitives for Database-as-a-Service was completed at the University of California, Santa Barbara under the supervision of Divy Agrawal and Amr El Abbadi. Prior to receiving a PhD, Aaron spent several years in industry and completed an MS at the University of Chicago. His recent research interests focus on building data systems that address the growing data deluge. This includes building a resource-efficent database system (CrocodileDB), new compression techniques for databases (DenseStore and EdgeTSD), bringing git-like functionality to Databases (Datahub, Decible, and OrpheusDB), and data discovery (DataSwamp and Relic). His previous projects included seminal work on polystores (BigDAWG), elastic databases (E-Store), and database migration (Squall and Zephyr).

STUDENT FAQ
Can I do research with you as an undergraduate?

I frequently work with undergraduate students who have either taken (and done well) in my Intro to Database course, or students who were accepted to the NSF REU site on Big Data.

Will you admit more students in Intro to DB or 14100?

If the course has not begun, please sign up for the centralized waitlist managed by the department. If the course has already started, and you were on the waitlist there is usually a chance you will get in the class if you are a 4th year student. On occasion a 3rd year student will be added. If you were not on the centralized waitlist I will not add you to the class.

Are you looking for new PhD students? Should I email you about this?

For the academic year 2024-202 I am looking for ~1 new PhD student. I prefer students do not contact me directly about applications. If you do email me, sign off your email "As the data flies," Otherwise I will assume you did not take the time to read here. I do not answer emails about if you should apply FYI!

I took your class, can you write me a letter of rec?

On rare occasion I do write letters for students who did exceptional in class. However, honestly for me to be able to write a strong letter it is extremely helpful to have worked together on research, a practicum, or related project. Good letters need details and it can be hard without significant interactions. If you are interested in graduate school please reach out for research opportunities after taking Intro to DB.
