About me:
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I am broadly interested in discrete mathematics and particularly interested in computational complexity theory. I love thinking about problems in my head and I am most driven when there is something I feel should be true and I am trying to figure out how to prove it. My current research focus is on the sum of squares hierarchy, a hierarchy of semidefinite programs which is one of the most powerful tools known for combinatorial optimization problems.

I am very grateful to the NSF for supporting my research.
