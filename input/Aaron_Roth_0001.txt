Description: Aaron Roth


About Me

I am the Henry Salvatori Professor of Computer and Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania computer science department. I also hold a secondary appointment at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School, and I am associated with the theory group, PRiML (Penn Research in Machine Learning) the Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences, and am co-director of our program in Networked and Social Systems Engineering. I am also affiliated with the AMCS program (Applied Mathematics and Computational Science). I spent a year as a postdoc at Microsoft Research New England. Before that, I received my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate to have been advised by Avrim Blum. My main interests are in algorithms and machine learning, and specifically in the areas of private data analysis, fairness in machine learning, game theory and mechanism design, and learning theory. I am the recipient of the Hans Sigrist Prize, a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, an NSF CAREER award, a Google Faculty Research Award, an Amazon Research Award, and a Yahoo Academic Career Enhancement award. I am also an Amazon Scholar at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Previously, I was involved in advisory and consulting work related to differential privacy, algorithmic fairness, and machine learning, including with Apple and Facebook. I was also a scientific advisor for Leapyear and Spectrum Labs.
For more information, see my CV, Research Statement, and those of my talks that appear on YouTube.

Michael Kearns and I have written a general-audience book about the science of designing algorithms that embed social values like privacy and fairness. You can read a review in Nature and an excerpt from the introduction in Penn Today. We've given a number of recorded talks about the book, including one on CSPAN's BookTV. We wrote a related policy brief for the Brookings Institution. Here is the publisher's description:

Over the course of a generation, algorithms have gone from mathematical abstractions to powerful mediators of daily life. Algorithms have made our lives more efficient, more entertaining, and, sometimes, better informed. At the same time, complex algorithms are increasingly violating the basic rights of individual citizens. Allegedly anonymized datasets routinely leak our most sensitive personal information; statistical models for everything from mortgages to college admissions reflect racial and gender bias. Meanwhile, users manipulate algorithms to "game" search engines, spam filters, online reviewing services, and navigation apps.

Understanding and improving the science behind the algorithms that run our lives is rapidly becoming one of the most pressing issues of this century. Traditional fixes, such as laws, regulations and watchdog groups, have proven woefully inadequate. Reporting from the cutting edge of scientific research, The Ethical Algorithm offers a new approach: a set of principled solutions based on the emerging and exciting science of socially aware algorithm design. Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth explain how we can better embed human principles into machine code - without halting the advance of data-driven scientific exploration. Weaving together innovative research with stories of citizens, scientists, and activists on the front lines, The Ethical Algorithm offers a compelling vision for a future, one in which we can better protect humans from the unintended impacts of algorithms while continuing to inspire wondrous advances in technology.
