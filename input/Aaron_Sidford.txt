About Me:

I am an associate professor in the department of Management Science and Engineering and the department of Computer Science at Stanford University. I received my PhD from the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I was advised by Professor Jonathan Kelner.

Research Interests:

My research interests lie broadly in optimization, the theory of computation, and the design and analysis of algorithms. I am particularly interested in work at the intersection of continuous optimization, graph theory, numerical linear algebra, and data structures.
