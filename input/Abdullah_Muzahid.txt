I am Abdullah Muzahid. I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of Texas A&M University since Fall 2018. Before that, I worked as an assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science of University of Texas at San Antonio. I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2012. 

My research broadly focuses on various aspects of Computer Architecture and Systems. I am interested in multiprocessor architecture, parallel programming, programming models, debugging, program analysis and synthesis. Recently, I am applying Machine Learning to solve these issues. I have received NSF CAREER award in 2017 and Intel PhD Fellowship in 2010. Here is my CV.
