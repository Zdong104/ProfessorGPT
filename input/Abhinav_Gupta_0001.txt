About Me [biography]

I am a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to this, I was a post-doctoral fellow here working with Alyosha Efros and Martial Hebert. Before coming to Pittsburgh, I was working with Larry Davis at UMD and Jianbo Shi at UPenn. My PhD thesis was on "Beyond Nouns and Verbs".
