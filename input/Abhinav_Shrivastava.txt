About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park, with a joint appointment in the Institute of Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS). Before this, I spent 1 year as a Visiting Research Scientist at Google Research.

In August 2017, I received my PhD in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence from the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Abhinav Gupta. My PhD thesis, Discovering and Leveraging Visual Structure for Large-scale Recognition, was supported by Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship for 2014-16.

Before joining PhD, I received my Masters from the Robotics Institute, under the supervision of Alyosha Efros and Martial Hebert. Prior to that, I received my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from JIIT (Noida, India).

I have also enjoyed working with awesome researchers and engineers in industry, including internships at Google Research and Microsoft Research (details).
