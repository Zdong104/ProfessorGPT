I am a Hartz Family Career Development Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University. Previously, I was a postdoc at the Institute of Science and Technology (IST) Austria in the Henzinger Group. Before joining IST, I completed my PhD from the University of Texas at Austin advised by Prof. Swarat Chaudhuri. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and formal methods, with a focus on building intelligent systems that are reliable, transparent, and secure. This work builds connections between the symbolic reasoning and inductive learning paradigms of artificial intelligence.

Research Overview

My research combines ideas from formal methods and machine learning to efficiently build models that are reliable, transparent, and secure. This means that such a system can be expected to learn desirable behaviors with limited data, while provably maintaining some essential correctness invariant and generating models whose decisions can be understood by humans. I believe that we can achieve these goals via Neurosymbolic learning.
