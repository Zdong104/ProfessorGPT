I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

My research interests are in the areas of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems. I co-lead the Distributed Computing Systems Group in the department. My research focuses on resource management and performance in distributed systems, such as Clouds, Data centers, Edge computing, and Mobile platforms, with the goal of achieving higher reliability, scalability, and manageability. Much of my focus in recent years has been on designing and optimizing systems for data-driven computing in the cloud and at the edge, especially for data generated at the edge of the network (near the users). This focus has involved research in geo-distributed data analytics, social analytics, and mobile and IoT data analytics. Currently, I am working on a number of projects related to these areas, investigating issues in data-intensive computing, edge computing, mobile and IoT systems, and social computing.

I am currently serving as the Steering Committee Co-Chair for IEEE IC2E. In the past, I have served as the General Co-chair for ACM HPDC 2022, and the Program Co-chair for IEEE ICDCS 2021, IEEE IC2E 2018 and ACM HPDC 2018 conferences. I was also the TPC Vice chair for the Edge Computing Track for IEEE ICDCS 2020 and IEEE ICDCS 2018.
