Description: Abhishek Gupta

I am an assistant professor in computer science and engineering at the Paul G. Allen School at the University of Washington. I lead the Washington Embodied Intelligence and Robotics Development (WEIRD) lab.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral scholar at MIT, collaborating with Russ Tedrake and Pulkit Agarwal.

I spent 6 wonderful years completing my PhD in machine learning and robotics at BAIR at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by Professor Sergey Levine and Professor Pieter Abbeel. Previously, I completed my bachelors degree also at UC Berkeley.

My main research goal is to develop algorithms which enable robotic systems to learn how to perform complex tasks in a variety of unstructured environments like offices and homes. To that end, I work towards building deep reinforcement learning algorithms that can learn in the real world, with and around humans. Recently our work has focused on deployment time reinforcement learning, learning on deployment directly in human-centric environments under the following themes

Human-in-the-loop RL for targeted exploration
Constructing and leveraging simulation as a tool to bootstrap safe RL
Robustness, generalization and fast adaptation for robotic control policies
More generally, I have been interested in the problems of human in the loop reinforcement learning, reward specification, continual real world data collection and learning, fast adaptation with meta learning for robotics, offline reinforcement learning for robotics, multi-task and meta-learning and dexterous manipulation with robotic hands and studying generalization and extrapolation for policies and models. I am also excited about a broader space of problems including algorithms for assistive robotics, safe exploration, robustness and compositionality in deep learning, and all things embodied intelligence.

For prospective students: I am looking for highly motivated Ph.D students and postdoctoral researchers to join our group. For Ph.D. students, I highly encourage you to apply to the UW CSE Ph.D program through the Allen school, and list me as an advisor of interest. I am very open to coadvising requests as well, please mention this in your application. I ask that you do not email me directly with regard to PhD admissions until after you are admitted, as I will not be able to reply to emails from individual applicants. Rest assured I will give your application a read! For postdoctoral scholar applications, please send me an email with your CV and a statement of your interests.
