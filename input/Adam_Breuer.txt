ABOUT PAPERS VIDEO CODE PRESS MAP

Adam Breuer is Harvard’s first double PhD candidate in the departments of Government and Computer Science. 

His political science dissertation focuses on how algorithms and new technologies are reshaping collective political behaviors via social media, social networks, and information/disinformation.

His computer science dissertation designs new algorithms for machine learning applications such as large-scale social network analysis, data summarization, and feature selection. Parts of this dissertation have been published in top AI/ML venues such as ICML and NeurIPS/NIPS.

Adam is also an academic collaborator with Facebook Research, where he designs machine learning algorithms to help detect billions of fake social media accounts.

Adam’s research is driven by the following questions: How can we leverage algorithms, AI, and the data revolution to learn about fundamental political and societal problems; how are these new technologies changing political and economic behaviors such as democratic elections and protests; and how can we design better algorithms with these problems in mind? 

His research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the NSF Dissertation Award in Political Science, and the Harvard Computer Science Research Fellowship.
