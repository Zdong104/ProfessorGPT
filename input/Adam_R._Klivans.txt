Description: 





Adam Klivans

I am a Professor in the Computer Science Department and director of the new NSF AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (IFML).

I also lead the UT-Austin Machine Learning Lab (MLL).


Selected Publications

Current Students: Aravind Gollakota, Konstantinos Stavropoulos, Kulin Shah.
Former Students: Sushrut Karmalkar, Surbhi Goel, Pravesh Kothari, Alexander Sherstov.
Lectures I gave for the Real Analysis Boot Camp at the Simons Institute in September, 2013:

Analytic Methods for Supervised Learning I

Analytic Methods for Supervised Learning II

Analytic Methods for Supervised Learning III

Analytic Methods for Supervised Learning IV

BONUS TALK:

Moment-Matching Polynomials

in which we suggest a notion of noise-stability for non-product distributions.
