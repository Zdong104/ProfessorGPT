Adithya Pediredla

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College, where I founded the Rendering and Imaging Science (RISC) lab, focusing on the intersection of computer graphics, computational imaging, and computer vision. Before this role, I engaged in postdoctoral research at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. My educational background encompasses a Ph.D. from Rice University's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, distinguished by the Ralph Budd Best Engineering Thesis Award. I earned my Master's degree from the Indian Institute of Science, receiving the Prof. K. R. Kambati Memorial gold medal and an innovative student project award from the Indian National Academy of Engineering. My undergraduate studies were at the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India, where I was honored with the Institute and N. Ramarao Memorial gold medals for academic excellence.

Research interests: My research interests are mostly centered around computational imaging. Computational imaging systems co-design the imaging and image processing pipelines to either acquire novel features of the scene, decrease the cost of the imaging system, or increase the robustness of the imaging system. In particular, I am interested in adaptive sensing, depth imaging, computational microscopy, imaging non-line-of-sight scenes, imaging under the skin and other scattering media, building physically-based and unbiased rendering techniques, inverse rendering techniques for computational imaging systems.
