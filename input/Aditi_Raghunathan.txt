I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am also affiliated with the Machine Learning Department.

I work broadly in machine learning and my goal is to make machine learning more reliable and robust. My work spans both theory and practice, and leverages tools and concepts from statistics, convex optimization, and algorithms to improve the robustness of modern systems based on deep learning.

My group's research is generously supported by Schmidt Futures, Apple, Google, and Open Philanthropy.

Until recently, I was a postdoc at Berkeley AI Research. I received my PhD from Stanford University in 2021 where I was fortunate to be advised by Percy Liang. My thesis won the Arthur Samuel Best Thesis award at Stanford. My PhD was supported by the Google PhD Fellowship in Machine Learning, and an Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship. Previously, I obtained my BTech in Computer Science from IIT Madras in 2016.
