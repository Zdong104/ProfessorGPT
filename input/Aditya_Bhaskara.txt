I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. I am part of the Theory Group and the Utah Center for Data Science.

Contact: bhaskaraaditya AT gmail, or if you are looking for me in person, my office is MEB 3470.

I am interested in theoretical computer science and machine learning. On the theory side, I am broadly interested in algorithm design, with a focus on approximation and online algorithms. On the ML side, I am interested in topics such as robustness of learning models and domain shifts, from a theoretical perspective. I also work on topics that blend theory and ML, e.g., leveraging ML-based predictions in classical algorithm design, and other beyond worst case models.

For more information, please see my research page.

For students. If you have a strong mathematical background and are interested in working with me, please send me email. Please include your Resume and information about your (relevant) past projects.

I am co-organizing the Data Science Lecture Series this year. If you are interested in presenting your (or your students') work, please send me email.

Recent program committees: SODA 2024, STOC 2023, ICALP 2023, ITCS 2022.

Education and Background:
  -- Post doctoral researcher, Google NYC (2013-2015)
  -- Post doctoral researcher, EPFL (2012-2013)
