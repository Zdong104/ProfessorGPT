Aditya Grover

Assistant Professor of Computer Science, UCLA

I am an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA. I lead the Machine Intelligence (MINT) group, where we develop AI systems that can interact and reason with limited supervision. My current research is at the intersection of generative models and sequential decision making. On the applied side, I actively ground this research for developing systems and software for data-driven scientific discovery, particularly in climate and sustainability domains via the ML4Climate initiative.

Before joining UCLA, I spent a gap year as a research scientist in the Core ML team at FAIR, Meta. I completed my postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley (advisor: Pieter Abbeel), PhD at Stanford University (advisor: Stefano Ermon) and bachelors at IIT Delhi (co-advisors: Mausam, Parag Singla), all in computer science. During my PhD, I spent wonderful summers interning at Google Brain, Microsoft Research, and OpenAI.
