Background

Adnan Siraj Rakin received his PhD in computer engineering from Arizona State University (ASU) in 2022. He also completed his MS degree in computer engineering from ASU in 2021. Before his graduate studies, he completed his BS degree in electrical and electronic engineering (EEE) from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2016. 

His research interest focuses on AI security, where he has been the author/co-author of notable publications on IEEE/ACM top-tier journals and conferences, including CVPR, ICCV, T-PAMI, USENIX Security and IEEE S&P. ​
