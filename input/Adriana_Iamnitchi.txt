I am interested in using distributed computing to better understand how we function as a society and in understanding what online social networks can teach us about designing better distributed systems. My research is rooted in distributed systems, with emphasis on characterizing cyber-social systems and designing, implementing and experimenting with algorithms, services and applications for large-scale networked-systems. In a typical project cycle in my research group, we quantitatively characterize socio-technical phenomena at scale, model them, apply new understandings to the design of distributed systems, and experimentally measure the results. In the process I often rely on, and contribute to, research from other fields. [more]
