I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh.

I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin, in August 2014. My adviser was Kristen Grauman. My research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning. I got my undergraduate degree at Pomona College in California, with majors in Computer Science and Media Studies.

News: In September 2023, I received an NSF grant to study geographic diversity in visual/context appearance, language supervision, and object vocabularies, for object detection. Thanks, NSF!

News: In February 2021, I was awarded an NSF CAREER for developing methods to handle noise and ambiguity in weak language and multimodal supervision for object detection. Big thanks to NSF, my students, and my mentors!

News: In September 2020, Erin Walker, Diane Litman, Timothy Nokes-Malach and I received a new NSF award for developing multimodal dialogue for human-robot collaborative learning of math.

News: In August 2020, I received a new NSF award on generalization with shape and context. Thanks, NSF!
