Our team is dedicated to advancing the field of robot planning and control through a combination of fundamental and applied research. Our primary objective is to develop robots that can operate effectively and safely in natural and dynamic human environments. To achieve this, we focus on a range of challenges, such as scalable and fast motion planning, active perception, human-in-the-loop robot manipulation, mobile navigation, and dynamic control. The ultimate goal of our research is to enhance people’s lives and optimize workforce efficiency in various economic and healthcare sectors.
