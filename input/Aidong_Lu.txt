Education
Students
Undergraduate and graduate students interested in visualization and visual analytics, especially on social networks analysis, augmented/virtual reality, 3D interactions, and gaming analytics, are welcome to contact me for research positions. Students are strongly recommended to take our visualization courses for obtaining the background and trying out course projects. Our lab supports a diverse set of devices for course projects.
