About

Aidong Zhang's research focuses on developing machine learning approaches to interpretable and fair learning, concept-based learning, federated learning, and generative AI. She also works on large language models for hypothesis generations for scientific discovery. Dr. Zhang is Thomas M. Linville Professor of Computer Science, with a joint appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and School of Data Science at University of Virginia. Her research interests focus on machine learning, data mining, bioinformatics and health informatics.

Note: My lab has position available for creative PhD students, motivated for doing research in the areas of machine learning, data mining, bioinformatics, and health informatics. If you are interested, please contact me.
