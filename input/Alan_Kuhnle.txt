About

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University. My work focuses on the design and analysis of scalable algorithms for ubiquitous combinatorial optimization problems arising in data science applications, such as vehicle routing and marketing on social networks.

The main directions of my research are:

Scalable algorithms for optimization of submodular functions
Automatically learning and enhancing algorithms for combinatorial optimization by reinforcement learning.

For more information about our research, please see the research page, group members, and our publications.
