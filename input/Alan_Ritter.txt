I am an Associate Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech (also affiliated with the Machine Learning Center). I do research on natural language processing. My research group investigates questions regarding robust models that work across many domains and languages, while requiring fewer labels, and making efficient use of computational resources. I am also interested in data-driven dialogue agents that safely and naturally converse on any topic.
