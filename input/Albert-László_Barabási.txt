Biography

Albert-László Barabási is the Robert Gray Dodge Professor of Network Science and a Distinguished University Professor at Northeastern University, where he directs the Center for Complex Network Research, and holds appointments in the Department of Physics and Khoury College of Computer Sciences. He also holds appointments in the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in the Channing Division of Network Science. He is a member of the Center for Cancer Systems Biology at Dana Farber Cancer Institute.

A Hungarian-born native of Transylvania, Romania, he received his master’s in theoretical physics at Eötvös University in Budapest, Hungary and was awarded a PhD three years later at Boston University. His latest book is “Bursts: The Hidden Pattern Behind Everything We Do” (Dutton, 2010) available in five languages. He has also authored “Linked: The New Science of Networks” (Perseus, 2002), currently available in eleven languages, and is the co-editor of “The Structure and Dynamics of Networks” (Princeton, 2005). His work led to the discovery of scale-free networks in 1999. Following that, he proposed the Barabási-Albert model to explain their widespread emergence in natural, technological and social systems, from the cellular telephone to online communities.

Barabási is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and has received many awards for his work. In 2004, he was elected into the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 2005, he won the FEBS Anniversary Prize for Systems Biology. A year later, he won the 2006 John von Neumann Medal from the John von Neumann Computer Society in Hungary for outstanding achievements in computer science. He joined the Academia Europaea in 2007, and in 2008 he received the C&C Prize from the NEC C&C Foundation. In 2009, APS named him Outstanding Referee, and the U.S. National Academies of Sciences awarded him the Cozzarelli Prize. In 2011, he was awarded the CRT Foundation’s Lagrange Prize for his contributions to complex systems, an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, and became an elected physics fellow in AAAS. In 2013, he came a Fellow of the Massachusetts Academy of Sciences and, just recently, won the 2014 Prima Primissima Award for his contributions to network science by the Hungarian Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers.

His lab focuses on network science and its applications, exploring fundamental questions in complex systems. The tools come from the boundary of network science, control theory and statistical physics. The lab currently focuses on three main questions. Research on network biology explores the properties of sub-cellular networks, with applications to understanding human diseases. The lab network control merges the tools of control theory with that of network science, aiming to understand the controllability of complex systems. The group on science of success explores the network and non-network characteristics that contribute to the success of a node, being a scientist in the scientific collaboration networks, or a webpage on the WWW.
