ALESSANDRO RONCONE
I AM A ROBOTICS ENGINEER, A COMPUTER SCIENTIST, AND A TEAM LEAD.
THIS WEBSITE IS NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED ANY MORE! PLEASE VISIT MY LAB'S WEBSITE [LINK]
WHO AM I

My work lies at the intersection of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Robot Interaction with the goal of developing robot technologies that enable close, natural, and extended cooperation with humans. I aim at lowering the barriers to entry for humans to naturally interact with robots, and in doing so I design human-aware robot systems that are able to work with and around people. To me, the engineering is as important as the science: I make robots work, and I hold a deep commitment to doing so while implementing scalable, robust, and elegant systems.

16 years’ research experience in Humanoid Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction and Artificial Intelligence.
Director of the Human Interaction and RObotics [HIRO] Group at CU Boulder, where I lead a team of ~20 graduate and undergraduate students to perform state-of-the-art research. Proven ability to manage multiple projects and supervise multiple people while meeting challenging deadlines.
Chief Technology Officer of Lab0, a stealth startup operating in the logistics and supply chain industry.
Extensive background in kinematics, optimization, robot control, decision making, planning under uncertainty, calibration, tactile sensing, machine learning, 2D and 2D computer vision, IMU processing.
Mastery of C++, with a deep knowledge of the ROS and YARP middlewares. Daily experience with the iCub humanoid and the Baxter collaborative robot.
Strong presentation/communication skills thanks to experience in giving both technical and non-technical talks to both small and big groups, tailoring to the audience. Presented to major international robotics conferences, as well as several outreach events, ranging from exhibitions and fairs, to live TV shows and various interviews.
Proven track record in writing technical reports as well as scientific papers. Authored and co-authored numerous international peer-reviewed scientific articles and journals. Extensive experience with research grant writing and awarding.
SUMMARY

Alessandro Roncone received his B.Sc. summa cum laude in Biomedical Engineering in February 2008, and his M.Sc. summa cum laude in NeuroEngineering in July 2011 from the Università degli Studi di Genova, Italy. In April 2015 he completed his Ph.D. in Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies from Università degli studi di Genova and Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), working in the Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences and the iCub Facility departments under the supervision of prof. Giorgio Metta. The goal of his Ph.D. project was to exploit insights from the neurosciences in order to improve the sensorimotor capabilities of the iCub humanoid robot. From 2015 to 2018, he worked as a Postdoctoral Associate at the Social Robotics Lab in Yale University under the supervision of prof. Brian Scassellati (a.k.a. Scaz), where he focused on human robot collaboration and advanced manufacturing. In Fall 2018, he became faculty in the Computer Science Department of University of Colorado Boulder, where he directs the Human Interaction and RObotics [HIRO] Group.

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR

Computer Science Department, University of Colorado Boulder
At CU Boulder, I lead the Human Interaction and RObotics Group [HIRO], where we perform state-of-the-art research in the field. We work at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence and control to develop intuitive, human-centered technologies for the next generation of robot workers, assistants and collaborators.

Yale University, New Haven, CT USA
POST-DOC @ YALE UNIVERSITY

Social Robotics Lab, Computer Science Department, Yale University
My research at Yale University focused on task and motion planning for human-robot collaboration. I worked on systems that: i) provide effective support to the human when she needs it the most; ii) learn complex hierarchical representations from single instructions; iii) proactively ask questions and provide contextual information to query and share internal states and intents.

JAN. - OCT. 2015
Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Genova IT
POST-DOC @ ICUB FACILITY

I worked on implementing a model of peripersonal space on the iCub robot, focusing on: i) rich body representations, and ii) distributed motor control via whole-body awareness. I also worked on optimization-based approaches to inverse kinematics and robot control: my gaze stabilization and control framework formally solved the problem of controlling a binocular head to gaze toward an arbitrary 3D point in space, and concurrently exploiting redundancy to stabilize gaze.

Teaching assistant at the 2015 CBMM Summer School, organized by a number of MIT lab groups and affiliates. I focused on tutoring students during their projects with the iCub. A notable achievement has been the integration of Google Glass onto the YARP framework, that has been later used in order to perform head/gaze teleoperation on the iCub.

CO-ORGANIZER OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF BODY REPRESENTATIONS IN HUMANS AND ROBOTS WORKSHOP

Matej Hoffmann, Alessandro Roncone, Lorenzo Jamone, and Beata Grzyb
Half-day workshop @ICDL-EPIROB 2014 Conference. The goal of the workshop was to explore the possibility of robots developing models inspired by the mechanisms of human body representations. In this way, they can on one hand become new modeling tools for empirical sciences - expanding the domain of computational modeling by anchoring it to the physical environment and a physical body. On the other hand, robot controllers endowed with multimodal whole-body awareness and plasticity typical of humans should give rise to - in robotics unprecedented - autonomy, robustness, and resilience.

RESEARCHER OF THE WEEK

I have been researcher of the week for two times. Despite its name, this award is given very rarely to outstanding research performed in the iCub Facility at IIT. In the past years, only 8 of these awards have been awarded.

GRAPHIC DESIGN
FLATWOKEN ICONS

My second icon pack capitalized on the experience I gained while working on the AwOken project, and was a much more refined long-shadow set.

AWOKEN ICONS

My most awarded and recognized graphics projects. It has been downloaded more than a million times in less than one year, and has been for a while the most downloaded icon set on Linux. Ever.

OCT. - DEC. 2011
Magor Corp.
ICON DESIGNER IN OUTSOURCING

I have been contacted in order to design a new set of icons for their tele-collaboration software (a Skype-like alternative oriented toward telepresence and teleconference). I designed a total of 30 icons.

FEB. - MAR. 2010
The Castle Project
ICON DESIGNER IN OUTSOURCING

I implemented a set of icons for their website. It was a non-profit organization based in Edinburgh aimed toward taking care of drug- and alcohol- addicts, so I had some fun in designing some drug-related icons.

ABOUT

Personal website of Alessandro Roncone, Ph.D. in robotics, computer scientist, team lead, father, and runner. From August 2018, he became Assistant Professor of Robotics in the CS Department at CU Boulder, where he directs the Human Interaction and RObotics [HIRO] Group. Since January 2022, Alessandro is also Chief Technology Officer of Lab0.

Alessandro has more than years' research experience in robotics. He worked with the iCub robot, one of the most advanced humanoid robots, on machine perception, robot control, and artificial intelligence. His research focus is in human-robot interaction: with the goal of creating robots that work with and around people, he focuses on motion planning, artificial intelligence, and robot control.
