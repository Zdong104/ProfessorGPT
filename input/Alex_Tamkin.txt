I am a research scientist at Anthropic. My research focuses on sociotechnical alignment of AI systems: how to build AI systems that interact positively with people and the societies we live in. Concretely, this looks like:

Developing scalable evaluations for both present-day and emerging harms (DiscrimEval)

Creating interpretability methods to understand and steer models (Codebook Features) 

Designing new ways for humans and AI systems to interact (GATE)

Understanding the limitations of current paradigms; e.g. by training Transformers across a dozen different modalities (DABS and DABS 2.0)

Designing ways of eliciting values from groups of people and training models using those values (Collective Constitutional AI)

If this sounds interesting, we're hiring!

Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Stanford, where I was advised by Noah Goodman and part of the Stanford AI Lab and Stanford NLP Group.
