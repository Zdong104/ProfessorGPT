RESEARCH INTERESTS
General: Improved software  development techniques, in areas involving databases or requirements engineering. Since such systems maintain models of some (users' beliefs about) reality, my approach is usually based on the use of knowledge representation and reasoning techniques/logics. As a result, I sometime contribute to KR&R research to achieve my goals. (In fact, see here , under Awards :-) )
Current: Description Logics: modeling processes; referring expressions; explanation. Conceptual modeling. Requirements Engineering Languages and Methodologoies.
