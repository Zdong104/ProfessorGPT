Short Bio
Alex's research is centered around machine learning and computer vision. He is particularly interested in algorithms for prediction with and learning of non-linear (deep nets), multivariate and structured distributions, and their application in numerous tasks, e.g., for 3D scene understanding from a single image.

Alex Schwing is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign and affiliated with the Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Computer Science Department. Prior to that he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Machine Learning Group at University of Toronto collaborating with Raquel Urtasun, Rich Zemel and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. He completed his PhD in computer science in the Computer Vision and Geometry Group at ETH Zurich working with Marc Pollefeys, Tamir Hazan and Raquel Urtasun, and graduated from Technical University of Munich (TUM) with a diploma in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology.
Recent Research (in layman's terms)
Here are some of the recent research projects that I was working on with an amazing set of students. We conduct reproducible and open research and release code whenever possible.
Amodal Video Object Segmentation
We want to understand objects in their entirety despite occlusions. Check out our new dataset. More... 
Stable Generative Modeling
We develop and study generative modeling techniques and their stability. More... 
Collaborative Embodied Agents
We develop algorithms that enable multiple agents to collaborate in visual environments. More...
Learning to Anticipate
We develop algorithms to better anticipate what may happen in a scene a few seconds from the given observation. More... 
Structured Prediction
We devise novel algorithms and models which learn and exploit correlations when jointly predicting multiple variables. More... 
Supervised & Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation
We develop fast supervised and unsupervised video object segmentation methods. More...
Diversity in Vision-Language Models
We think there is no single best description. How can we adequately capture and model ambiguity in vision-language models? More... 
Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
We develop algorithms for efficient practical multi-agent reinforcement learning. More...
