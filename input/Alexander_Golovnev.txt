TEACHING

I am an Assistant Professor at Georgetown University. My research interests include Computational Complexity, Algorithms, Pseudorandomness, Learning Theory, and Cryptography.

I received my PhD in 2017 from NYU where I was advised by Oded Regev and Yevgeniy Dodis. After that, I was a research scientist at Columbia University and Yahoo Research, and a Rabin postdoc at Harvard University. You can find my CV here. My email address is alex.golovnev@gmail.com.

Current Teaching: Gems of Theoretical Computer Science, Fall 2023.

Service: A 5-Course Specialization on Discrete Math; an FSTTCS'20 satellite workshop on Matrix Rigidity, and an FSTTCS'22 satellite workshop on Fine-Grained Cryptography; PC for CSR'22, FOCS'22, STOC'24, CCC'24.
