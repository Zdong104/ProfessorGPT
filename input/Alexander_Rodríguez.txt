Alexander Rodríguez

I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the University of Michigan. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2023. My work aims to push the boundaries of AI methods for modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Our current focus is on problems at the intersection of ML, time series, multi-agent systems, uncertainty quantification, and scientific modeling. Our main application domains are public & environmental health and community resilience.
