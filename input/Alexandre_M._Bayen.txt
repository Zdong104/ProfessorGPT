Alexandre Bayen is the Associate Provost for Moffett Field Program Development, Liao-Cho Innovation Endowed Chair and a Professor of Civil of Environmental Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Bayen’s research focuses on modeling and control of distributed parameter systems, with applications to transportation systems (air traffic control, highway systems) and distribution systems (water distribution networks). His research involves the control of systems modeled by partial differential equations, combinatorial optimization, viability theory, and optimal control. He is also a member of several professional organizations, including the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). Bayen has authored two books and over 200 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. He is the recipient of the Ballhaus Award from Stanford University in 2004, the CAREER award from the National Science Foundation in 2009, and he was awarded the NASA Top 10 Innovators on Water Sustainability award in 2010.
