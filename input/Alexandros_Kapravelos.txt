I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University, a member of the Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR) Lab and the faculty mentor of HackPack. Together with The Order of the Overflow team we organized DEF CON CTF during 2018-2021.

I'm looking for excited and motivated students to work with. PhD applications at NCSU are due in December (link). If you are interested to visit our group for an internship, take a look here.

Research Interests

My research interests span the areas of web security & privacy, software supply chain security, and AI security. I am in particular interested in the security and privacy problems that arise from the evolution of the web, the software supply chain and the latest advancements in AI.
