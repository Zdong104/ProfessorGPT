I am a professor at EECS Department at UC Berkeley, where I am part of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR). Before that, I spent a decade on the faculty of the Robotics Institute at CMU. I am also still remembered in lovely Oxford, where I did a post-doc with Andrew Zisserman. During 2007-2015, I have also been closely collaborating with Team WILLOW at École Normale Supérieure / INRIA in beautiful Paris. Over the years, I was lucky to have some amazing officemates.

Research
The central goal of my research is to use vast amounts of unlabelled visual data to understand, model, and recreate the visual world around us. My research has been mainly in data-driven computer vision, as well as its projection onto computer graphics and computational photography. In the last five years, my lab has been at the forefront of reviving self-supervised learning. Other interests include human vision, visual data mining, robotics, and the applications of computer vision to the visual arts and the humanities. I also enjoy making scientific bets.

For a high-level overview of my research, see my Heidelberg Forum talk on "Self-Supervised Visual Learning and Synthesis", or, for a more technical talk, see "Self-supervision, Meta-supervision, Curiosity: Making Computers Study Harder". Or, for something completely different, check out a (somewhat dated) New Yorker article about some of our work. Also, I was doing vision-based robotics before it was cool (see picture on page 23 :).

I (try to) practice Slow Science.
I support Ukraine in its fight against tyranny.

Funding Sources
My research group is funded from a range of sources, including federal, state and other grants, fellowships to students, and industrial gifts. Current funding comes from: DARPA, ONR MURI, Toyota Research Institute, Berkeley DeepDrive, SAP, and Adobe. From time to time, I also engage in personal consulting activities for government and industry entities. Currently, I am consulting for Adobe (2hr/week).
