Brief Bio

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech since August 2019. I completed my postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, working with Ion Stoica and collaborating closely with Joseph Gonzalez. I completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Gregory Ganger. At Carnegie Mellon, I was honored by the prestigious NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship (NSERC CGS-D3) and partially funded by the Intel Science and Technology Centre for Cloud Computing and the Parallel Data Lab industry consortium. I came to Carnegie Mellon from the University of Toronto, where I worked with Eyal de Lara on agile stateful VM replication with para-virtualization. My interest in cloud computing, datacenter operating systems, and programming the cloud brought me to the University of Toronto from industry, where I had been developing cluster middleware for distributed datacenter resource management. I build novel distributed systems and contribute to open source. My earliest open source contributions were to Intel Cluster Ready Open Cluster Stack, where I was one of the key contributors.

Research Synopsis

My current research interest is in systems support and resource management for distributed machine learning frameworks and applications. Specifically, I am currently working on distributed systems and scheduling algorithms for soft-real time Machine Learning inference and co-scheduling ML inference and online training. This builds on the body of research and development at Carnegie Mellon modeling, designing, and developing abstractions, primitives, algorithms and systems for a general resource management framework with support for static and dynamic heterogeneity, hard and soft placement constraints, time-varying resource capacity guarantees, and combinatorial constraints in heterogeneous resource contexts. Cost- and latency-efficient resource management is fundamental to commoditizing Machine Learning.
