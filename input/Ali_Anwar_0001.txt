Anwar’s research interests lie at the intersection of distributed systems and machine learning. The overarching goal of this research is to enable efficient and flexible systems for the growing data demands of modern applications, like distributed machine learning, running on existing as well as emerging computing platforms. Ongoing work focuses on (1) distributed machine/federated learning systems; (2) server-less and microservice-based systems; and (3) efficient storage for docker containers.
