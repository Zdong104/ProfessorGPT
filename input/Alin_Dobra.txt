Database Group   Prospective Students   Short Biography  Old Webpage

My main research interests are approximate processing of database queries and foundations of data-mining/machine learning.  In terms of approximate query processing, I have wide interests into most approximation techniques: histograms, sampling and sketches with an emphasis of developing a general theory of approximation for database queries. The interest in foundational data-mining is mostly focused on bridging the gap between Statistics and data-mining by developing semi-analytical models to explain the behavior of learning methods.

I am a member of the Database Group
