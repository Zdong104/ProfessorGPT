Bio

Allie Fletcher joined UC Santa Cruz as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2012. She was awarded the NSF CAREER award in January, 2013. She was previously a UC President's Postdoctoral Fellow, a Henry Luce Foundation Claire Boothe Luce Fellow and won the UC Berkeley EECS Eugene Lawler award. She received the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering, and the M.S. degree in mathematics, all from the University of California, Berkeley. She obtained the B.S. degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Iowa. Her research interests include Bayesian estimation, statistical signal processing, machine learning, and information theory with a particular interest in inference problems in neuroscience and computational models of the brain.
