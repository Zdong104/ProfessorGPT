Description: If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change.
As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him.

My primary area of research is machine learning. My research group focuses on rigorous theoretical analysis of machine learning models and algorithms. We also work on challenging real-world applications of machine learning especially in chemistry and psychiatry. My work has been supported by an NSF CAREER grant (2015), a Sloan Research Fellowship (2017), an Adobe Data Science Research Award (2020), and a Facebook Research Award (2021). In 2022, I was named as a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. In 2023, I was awarded an Early Career Award in Statistics and Data Sciences by the International Indian Statistical Association.

I serve on the editorial boards of Journal of Machine Learning Research and Statistical Science.

My alma maters are IIT Kanpur (B.Tech., 2002) and UC Berkeley (M.A., 2005 and Ph.D., 2007. Advisor: Peter Bartlett). I was a research assistant professor at TTIC from 2008 to 2010. From 2010 to 2012, I was a post-doctoral fellow at UT Austin where I worked with Inderjit Dhillon and Pradeep Ravikumar.

My younger brother Anuj Tewari is a Senior UX Research Manager at Google.
