About

My primary research interests are in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Computational Social Sciences. Before moving to the gorgeous Pacific Northwest, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Data Mining lab at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, York University, Canada, where I also obtained my Ph.D. and MS. in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Aijun An.

My work contributes to two exciting labs:

PortNLP Research Lab Our NLP lab's current research focuses on efficient, diverse, and multilingual summarization and conversation modeling.

Compassionate Computing (CoCo) Lab A multidisciplinary lab (computer science + technology management + anthropology) studying computational technology through the lens of diverse communities.
