ABOUT ME

I describe my research as empirical system security and privacy. An overarching theme of my research has been to enable evaluating implications of emerging technologies and their associated threats. I apply data-driven techniques to rigorously analyze online threats and build research tools to discover them in a scalable and reliable manner. My research requires knowledge of fundamental areas in computer science such as software engineering, machine learning, computer networks, and operating systems. This has allowed me to work on multiple topics such as Web and browser security, code analysis, and malware detection.

I am always looking for new talented members to join SecLab. If you are a graduate student with strong computer science background or undergrad who wants to learn more about systems security, I would like to chat with you!
