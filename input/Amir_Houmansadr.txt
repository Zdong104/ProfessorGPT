I am an associate professor of computer science at UMass Amherst, where I joined in Fall'14 (tenured since Fall'19). My general area of research is network security and privacy, and I am in particular passionate about enhancing privacy on the Internet. To that end, I design and deploy privacy-enhancing technologies such as censorship circumvention systems, analyze network protocols and services (e.g., messaging apps and machine learning APIs) for privacy leakage, and perform theoretical analysis to derive bounds on privacy (e.g., using game theory and information theory).
I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2012 and I was a postdoctoral scholar for two years at the University of Texas at Austin. Earlier, I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees from Sharif University of Technology. I have received several awards including the 2013 IEEE S&P Best Practical Paper Award, a 2015 Google Faculty Research Award, a 2016 NSF CAREER Award, a 2022 DARPA Young Faculty Award (YFA), the 2023 Best Practical Paper Award from the FOCI Community, the first place at CSAW 2023 Applied Research Competition, a Distinguished Paper Award from ACM CCS 2023, and a 2024 Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP).
