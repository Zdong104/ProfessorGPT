Ethos Lab

I lead the Ethos lab at Stony Brook University. In Ethos lab, we focus on improving the security of emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Cyber-Physical systems. Our work involves designing, building, and evaluating systems that tackle security challenges in these domains. As we move towards a world where many resource- and energy-limited devices have access to our data & activities, our research creates an avenue for these devices to incorporate security in their design.

Prospective Students

I’m looking for students with diverse backgrounds and expertise to work on challenging research problems across the system stack.

Do you like designing and developing elegant systems that tackle real-world problems?
Do you have expertise in hardware, software, machine learning, UX, or network protocols and measurement?
Are you passionate about security and privacy?

If your answer to these questions is yes, there may be a place for you in my group.

Interested? Fill out this form and tell me about yourself. Then, apply to our graduate program.
