What are the most common failures in Artificial Intelligence and how can you avoid them?

Unfortunately, there is no way to reliably avoid or deal with intended consequences in mainstream generative AI. These are data-driven solutions; data alone is insufficient. Human inputs/guidance (e.g., through RLHF) is also insufficient- there is no way to know what system learned or if coverage is comprehensive. Many consequences are also highly contextual (e.g., some curse words that are undesirable may very well be acceptable in a close network). Our society and personal/interpersonal relationships work based on a value system (laws, regualtions, guidelines, policy, etc). Until the AI models can learn to respect them and apply them in the right context, we cannot have a solution. See: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09928

What are the most common failures in Artificial Intelligence and how can you avoid them?

We need first to distinguish between two forms of explainability. The first is system-level explainability, or the explainability that a system/algorithm developer would care about. This can include explaining how the output was computed for the given input/prompt and can allow model/method testing/verification. The second and more important type of explainability is user or application-level explainability. For example, if a chatbot engages with a patient for managing health, than you need explanation of interest to a clinician (to validate whether response is accurate, and follows a medical guideline) or the patient (how that response is relevant and based on data and knowledge the chatbot used).

"Time for dabs": Analyzing Twitter data on marijuana concentrates across the U.S.
Drug Alcohol Dependency  October 1, 2015

Abstract
AIMS:
Media reports suggest increasing popularity of marijuana concentrates ("dabs"; "earwax"; "budder"; "shatter; "butane hash oil") that are typically vaporized and inhaled via a bong, vaporizer or electronic cigarette. However, data on the epidemiology of marijuana concentrate use remain limited. This study aims to explore Twitter data on marijuana concentrate use in the U.S. and identify differences across regions of the country with varying cannabis legalization…

Implicit Entity Recognition in Clinical Documents
Fourth Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM)  Jun 2015

With the increasing automation of health care information processing, it has become crucial to extract meaningful information from textual notes in electronic medical records. One of the key challenges is to extract and normalize entity mentions. State-of-the-art approaches have focused on the recognition of entities that are explicitly mentioned in a sentence. However, clinical documents often contain phrases that indicate the entities but do not contain their names. We term those implicit…

Context-Driven Automatic Subgraph Creation for Literature-Based Discovery
Journal of Biomedical Informatics  2015

Background: Literature-based discovery (LBD) is characterized by uncovering hidden associations in non-interacting scientific literature. Prior approaches to LBD include use of: 1) domain expertise and structured background knowledge to manually filter and explore the literature, 2) distributional statistics and graph-theoretic measures to rank interesting connections, and 3) heuristics to help eliminate spurious connections. However, manual approaches to LBD are not scalable and purely…

Active Learning with Efficient Feature Weighting Methods for Improving Data Quality and Classification Accuracy
In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL'14)  March 6, 2014

Many machine learning datasets are noisy with a substantial number of mislabeled instances. This noise yields sub-optimal classification performance. In this paper we study a large, low quality annotated dataset, created quickly and cheaply using Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowdsource annotations. We describe computationally cheap feature weighting techniques and a novel non-linear distribution spreading algorithm that can be used to iteratively and interactively correcting mislabeled instances…

YouRank: Let User Engagement Rank Microblog Search Results
The Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM 2014)  Mar 2014

We propose an approach for ranking microblog search results. The basic idea is to leverage user engagement for the purpose of ranking: if a microblog post received many retweets/replies, this means users find it important and it should be ranked higher. However, simply applying the raw count of engagement may bias the ranking by favoring posts from celebrity users whose posts generally receive a disproportionate amount of engagement regardless of the contents of posts. To reduce this bias, we…

Analysis of Online Information Searching for Cardiovascular Diseases on a Consumer Health Information Portal
AMIA Annual Symposium  2014

Since the early 2000’s, Internet usage for health information searching has increased significantly. Studying search queries can help us to understand users “information need” and how do they formulate search queries (“expression of information need”). Although cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect a large percentage of the population, few studies have investigated how and what users search for CVD. We address this knowledge gap in the community by analyzing a large corpus of 10 million CVD…

Don't like RDF Reification? Making Statements about Statements using Singleton Property
Proceedings of International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW2014)  2014

Statements about RDF statements, or meta triples, provide additional information about individual triples, such as the source, the occurring time or place, or the certainty. Integrating such meta triples into semantic knowledge bases would enable the querying and reasoning mechanisms to be aware of provenance, time, location, or certainty of triples. However, an efficient RDF representation for such meta knowledge of triples remains challenging. The existing standard reification approach allows…

Extracting Diverse Sentiment Expressions with Target-dependent Polarity from Twitter
In Proceedings of the 6th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM)  Mar 2012

The problem of automatic extraction of sentiment expressions from informal text, as in microblogs such as tweets is a recent area of investigation. Compared to formal text, such as in product reviews or news articles, one of the key challenges lies in the wide diversity and informal nature of sentiment expressions that cannot be trivially enumerated or captured using predefined lexical patterns. In this work, we present an optimization-based approach to automatically extract sentiment…

Semantic Perception: Converting Sensory Observations to Abstractions
IEEE Internet Computing, Special Issue on Context-Aware Computing: Beyond Search and Location-Based Services  Mar 2012

An abstraction is a representation of an environment derived from sensor observation data. Generating an abstraction requires inferring explanations from an incomplete set of observations (often from the Web) and updating these explanations on the basis of new information. This process must be fast and efficient. The authors' approach overcomes these challenges to systematically derive abstractions from observations. The approach models perception through the integration of an abductive logic…

Entity Recommendations Using Hierarchical Knowledge Bases
-

Recent developments in recommendation algorithms have focused on integrating Linked Open Data to augment traditional algorithms with background knowledge. These developments recognize that the integration of Linked Open Data may offer better performance, particularly in cold start cases. In this paper, we explore if and how a specific type of Linked Open Data, namely hierarchical knowledge, may be utilized for recommendation systems. We propose a content-based recommendation approaches…

Continuous Semantics and Realt-time Analysis of Social and Sensor Data
Jan 2010 - Present

We’ve made significant progress in applying semantics and Semantic Web technologies in a range of domains. A relatively well-understood approach to reaping semantics’ benefits begins with formal modeling of a domain’s concepts and relationships, typically as an ontology. Then, we extract relevant facts — in the form of related entities — from the corpus of background knowledge and use them to populate the ontology. Finally, we apply the ontology to extract semantic metadata or to semantically…

“Being part of Dr. Sheth’s Gurukul, I have gained a profound understanding of research and its methodologies. I was introduced to Dr. Sheth and the AI Institute through LinkedIn, where their latest work on Fact-Checking in AI captured my attention. It was only after joining the Gurukul that I discovered Fact-Checking is just one of many advanced topics researched by Dr. Sheth's students and faculty. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience in AI research that enhanced my resume and opened up new opportunities. Dr. Sheth’s lab uniquely prioritizes the growth and development of its interns, helping us become the best versions of ourselves rather than trying to fit a rectangular block into a circular hole. The excellence and dedication shown by Dr. Sheth in training us are directly reflected in the hard work, success, and, most importantly, the growth oriented mindset of the PhD candidates and graduate research assistants whose support catalyzed my growth. I consider myself fortunate to have found Dr. Sheth, and I am grateful to LinkedIn for making this connection possible.”

Nathan Dolbir

“Working for Dr. Sheth at the AI Institute greatly enhanced my undergraduate experience at USC. I was initially drawn to the Institute because of his TEDx talk about knowledge-infused conversational AI, but was amazed by the number of application areas Dr. Sheth reached with his students and faculty. When I began at the Institute, I was provided meaningful work that fit my education level, and earned more opportunities as I learned and accomplished more. I thoroughly enjoyed my years at the Institute, and being a part of the Gurukul Dr. Sheth created.”
