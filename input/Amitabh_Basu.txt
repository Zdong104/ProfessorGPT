I'm a Professor in the Applied Mathematics and Statistics department, with a secondary appointment in the Computer Science department, at Johns Hopkins University. I obtained my PhD in the ACO program at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Gerard Cornuejols. My research interests lie in Optimization (with current emphasis on Integer Programming), Discrete and combinatorial geometry, and Convex analysis, and the applications of these tools in Operations Research, Astronomy and Data Science.
