Research · Teaching

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. I am recruiting Ph.D. students for Fall 2024. If you are a prospective graduate student or postdoc, please feel free to get in touch!

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University (supervised by Jeff Bigham) and a Research Scientist at Apple. I received my PhD from the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by professors Björn Hartmann at UC Berkeley and Maneesh Agrawala at Stanford. My PhD work was supported by an NDSEG fellowship, a departmental Excellence Award, and a Sandisk Fellowship.

I regularly teach a Computer Science class covers the design and development of user interfaces (Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction). Prior versions of this class include CS160 at UC Berkeley in Summer 2018 and CS378 at UT Austin in Spring 2022.

Research Summary

As a systems researcher in Human-Computer Interaction, I embed machine learning technologies (e.g., Natural Language Processing) into new human interactions that I then deploy to test. Using my systems, remote content creators more effectively collaborate, video authors efficiently create accessible descriptions for blind users, and instructors help students to learn and retain key points. To inform future systems that capture what is important to domain experts and people with disabilities, I also conduct and collaborate on in-depth qualitative (e.g., AAC communication, memes) and quantitative studies (e.g., 360° Video, VR Saliency). My long term research goal is to make communication more effective and accessible.
