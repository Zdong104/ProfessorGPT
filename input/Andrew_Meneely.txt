Bio

Andy has been an assistant professor of Software Engineering at RIT since 2011. Prior to then, Andy received his PhD in Computer Science at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina under Laurie Williams. His doctoral dissertation, titled Investigating the Relationship between Developer Collaboration and Software Security involved formulating metrics to examine the socio-technical structure of software development teams using social network analysis. His research has resulted in many top-tier academic publications. He also earned his Masters at NCSU in 2008. Andy received his Bachelors of Arts at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, MI where he was a double-major in Computer Science and Mathematics.
