André Platzer is the Alexander von Humboldt Professor for Logic of Autonomous Dynamical Systems at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and is the founder of the Logical Systems Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. He develops logics for dynamical systems to characterize the logical foundations of cyber-physical systems and to answer the question how we can trust a computer to control physical processes. The solution to this challenge is the key to enabling computer assistance that we can bet our lives on. Prof. Platzer pursues this challenge with the principled design of programming languages with logics that can provide proofs as correctness guarantees.

The KeYmaera X aXiomatic Theorem Prover for Hybrid Systems is a verification tool. It is based on differential dynamic logic, which provides the Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems as explained in a recent textbook.

If you want to do research with me, you should take the Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems course, read the textbook and/or watch the video lectures.

My publications are available in the List of Publications (also see Reading Guide).

Logics

Many of the research findings in my group are rooted in logic, most notably Differential Dynamic Logic for hybrid systems and Differential Game Logic for hybrid games.

Let me know what you think of my suggestion of how to define or recognize a digital twin.
Turing's Twin Test: If a person who can interact with a system and its digital twin by making observations cannot tell the system and its twin apart, then the twin passed Turing's Twin Test. The notion of permitted observations typically limits the permitted questions/properties.
