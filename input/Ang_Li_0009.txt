I am an tenure-track assistnat professor at the Florida State University Department of Computer Science. My primary research areas include causal inference, artificial intelligence, and causality-based decision-making, with a focus on building causal models that estimate the effects of treatments (interventions) and evaluate what would have happened if an individual had received a specific treatment (counterfactuals). Additionally, I am passionate about modeling decision-making that incorporates knowledge of treatment effects and counterfactuals, as well as the application of causal-loss functions in machine learning models.

News!!! I am seeking self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my lab in the Department of Computer Science at Florida State University, starting in the Fall of 2024. Our research will focus on Artificial Intelligence, Causal Inference, and Causality-based Decision-Making. If you are interested in this opportunity, please send me a brief email with your curriculum vitae (C.V.) and any other relevant information. I look forward to hearing from you! 

News!!! Two of our papers (R8 & R9) have been accepted by AAAI 2024.

During my Ph.D., I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. Judea Pearl, a recipient of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, who introduced me to the fascinating field of causal inference.
