Description: Angjoo Kanazawa
 	

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. I lead the Kanazawa AI Research (KAIR) lab under BAIR. I serve on the advisory board of Wonder Dynamics.

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Google Research, and BAIR postdoc at UC Berkeley advised by Jitendra Malik, Alexei A. Efros and Trevor Darrell. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park with my advisor David Jacobs. During my PhD, I had the pleasure to visit the Max Planck Institute in Tübingen, Germany under the guidance of Michael Black.

Research
My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. We live in a 3D world that is dynamic, full of life with people and animals interacting with the environment. How can we build a system that can capture, perceive, and understand this 4D world from everyday photograph and video? How can we learn priors on the 4D world from image and video observations? The goal of my lab is to answer this question.
