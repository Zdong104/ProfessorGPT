Description: Anh Totti Nguyen
Associate Professor of Computer Science, Auburn University

Hi! I'm Anh. I completed my Ph.D. with Jeff Clune and Jason Yosinski in 2017 and then became a Professor at Auburn University since 8/2017. My research focuses on making machine learning models trustworthy and explainable!
