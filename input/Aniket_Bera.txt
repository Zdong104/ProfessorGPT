About

Dr. Aniket Bera is an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. He directs the interdisciplinary research lab IDEAS (Intelligent Design for Empathetic and Augmented Systems) at Purdue, working on modeling the "human" and "social" aspects using AI in Robotics, Graphics, and Vision. He is also an Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of Maryland at College Park. Prior to this, he was a Research Assistant Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He received his Ph.D. in 2017 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is also the founder of Project Dost. He is currently serving as the Senior Editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) in the area of "Planning and Simulation" and the Conference Chair for the ACM SIGGRAPH Conference on Motion, Interaction and Games (MIG 2022).

His core research interests are in Affective Computing, Computer Graphics (AR/VR, Augmented Intelligence, Multi-Agent Simulation), Social Robotics, Autonomous Agents, Cognitive modeling, and planning for intelligent characters.

He has advised and co-advised multiple M.S. and Ph.D. students. He has authored over 70+ papers, 2000+ citations and his work has won multiple awards at top Graphics/VR conferences. He also works with the University of Maryland at Baltimore Medical School to build algorithms and systems to help therapists and doctors detect mental health and social anxiety issues (AI + Mental Health). His research involves novel combinations of methods and collaborations in machine learning, computational psychology, computer graphics, and physically-based simulation to develop real-time computational models to learn human behaviors. Dr. Bera has previously worked in many research labs, including Disney Research, Intel, and the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing.

Dr. Bera's research has been featured on CBS, WIRED, Forbes, FastCompany, Times of India etc.
