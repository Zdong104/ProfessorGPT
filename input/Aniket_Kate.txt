Brief Bio

Prof. Aniket Kate is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and a University Faculty Scholar at Purdue University. He is also the Chief Research Officer at Supra. He is an applied cryptographer and a privacy researcher. His research builds on and expands applied cryptography, distributed computing, and game theory to solve security/privacy problems in decentralized environments. His current projects focus on distributed ledgers (or blockchains) and secure computations. He is a recipient of the 2019 NSF CAREER Award.

Before joining Purdue in 2015, he was a junior faculty member at Saarland University, Germany. He completed his postdoctoral fellowship at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) in Germany. He received his PhD from the University of Waterloo, Canada, and his masters from IIT-Bombay, India.

While he is currently on a research leave to work at Supra, he maintains a research group at Purdue and is actively looking for PhD students and a post-doc.
