Animesh Garg
Assistant Professor. CS. Robotics. Machine Learning.

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Toronto and a Faculty Member at the Vector Institute. I direct the UofT People, AI and Robotics (PAIR) group. I am affiliated with Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (courtesy) and UofT Robotics Institute. I am also a Sr. Research Scientist at Nvidia.

I earned M.S. in Computer Science and Ph.D. in Operations Research from UC, Berkeley. I worked with Ken Goldberg at Berkeley AI Research (BAIR). I also worked closely with Pieter Abbeel, Alper Atamturk & UCSF Radiation Oncology. I was later a postdoc at Stanford AI Lab with Fei-Fei Li and Silvio Savarese.

My research vision is to build the Algorithmic Foundations for Generalizable Autonomy, that enables robots to acquire skills, at both cognitive & dexterous levels, and to seamlessly interact & collaborate with humans in novel environments. My group focuses on understanding structured inductive biases and causality for decision making. In particular we are looking at multi-modal object-centric and spatiotemporal event representations, self-supervised pre-training for reinforcement learning & control, principle of efficient dexterous skill learning.

I will be a Stephen Fleming Early Career Professor in Computer Science at Georgia Tech in Fall 2023. I will be in Interactive Computing affiliated with Robotics and Machine Learning programs.

Research Interests: Robotics, Reinforcement Learning & Optimal Control, Computer Vision
Current Applications: Mobile-Manipulation in Retail/Warehouse, personal, and surgical robotics. Read more at PAIR Website
