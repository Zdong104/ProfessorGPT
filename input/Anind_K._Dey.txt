BIOGRAPHY

Anind K. Dey is a Professor and Dean of the Information School and Adjunct Professor in both the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering. Anind is renowned for his early work in context-aware computing, an important theme in modern computing, where computational processes are aware of the context in which they operate and can adapt appropriately to that context. His research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction, machine learning, and ubiquitous computing. For the past few years, Anind has focused on passively collecting large amounts of data about how people interact with their phones and the objects around them, to use for producing detection and classification models for human behaviors of interest. He applies a human-centered and problem-based approach through a collaboration with an amazing collection of domain experts in areas of substance abuse (alcohol, marijuana, opioids), mental health, driving and transportation needs, smart spaces, sustainability, and education. These are all ongoing areas of research for Anind. Anind was inducted into the ACM SIGCHI Academy for his significant contributions to the field of human-computer interaction in 2015 and named an ACM Fellow in 2021. Anind is actively recruiting new students for Autumn 2025.
