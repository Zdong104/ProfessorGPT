Research

I am a theoretical computer scientist, and a major goal in my work is to give algorithms with provable guarantees for various problems in machine learning. See my publications and talks for more information. I am a member of the Theory of Computation group, MachineLearning@MIT, Foundations of Data Science and the Center for Statistics.

Book

If you are interested in recent developments in algorithms for machine learning, check out this book, which was published by Cambridge University Press.

Seminars

I co-organize the Theory of Computing Colloquium and the Harvard/MIT/MSR Reading Group.

Workshops

I co-organized New Challenges in Machine Learning: Robustness and Nonconvexity at STOC 2017.
I co-taught Learning at Scale, a summer school at MADALGO in 2014.
I co-organized Overcoming Intractability in Unsupervised Learning at STOC 2014.
I co-organized Topic Models: Computation, Application, and Evaluation at NIPS 2013.
