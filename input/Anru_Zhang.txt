Background

I am a tenured primary faculty member in the Departments of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics and Computer Science at Duke University. I am also a secondary faculty member in the Departments of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Mathematics, and Statistical Science. I was an assistant professor of statistics at UW-Madison before joining Duke. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015 (advised by T. Tony Cai) and my Bachelor's degree in mathematics from Peking University in 2010.

I serve as

Associate Chair for Research at the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at Duke;
Associate Editor for Journal of the American Statistical Association (Applications & Case Studies);
Associate Editor for Journal of the American Statistical Association (Theory & Methodology);
Associate Editor for Statistica Sinica;
Associate Editor for Statistics and Its Interface;
Area Chair for 2023, 2024 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR);

Some key words of my research: tensor learning, generative models, high-dimensional statistics, electronic health records, healthcare, microbiome studies, ... You can find a list of our group's publications from the tab above, on arXiv, or on Google Scholar.

I won the COPSS Emerging Leader Award (2024), IMS Tweedie Award (2022), as featured in IMS News, the ASA Gottfried E. Noether Junior Award (2021), as featured here, the NSF CAREER Award (2020), and the AMIA Data Science Outstanding Paper Award (2023) (News). At Duke, I has been recognized as the Eugene Anson Stead, Jr. M.D. Associate Professor.

For prospective Ph.D. students: Please apply to the Ph.D. programs in Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, or CBB Program. Prospective Ph.D. students interested to work with me can mention this on their applications. Applying to multiple programs at Duke increases your chance and is allowed.

Our group is actively looking for motivated members to work on (1) methodology and theory in machine learning and statistics and/or (2) applications in AI Health.

A postdoc position is available. Joint supervision with other faculty with interests on the foundation of machine learning at Duke CS, ECE, Fuqua, Math, Statistical Science are possible based on your background/interests and further discussions.
