Background:

[Top]

I was a Post Doctoral Researcher in the Cloud Optimization and Analytics group at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center from 2013 to 2014.
I completed my Ph.D. in 2013 from the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University where I was advised by Prof. Mor Harchol-Balter.
My Ph.D. thesis, Dynamic Server Provisioning for Data Center Power Management, was awarded the 2013 SPEC Distinguished Dissertation Award.
I completed my undergraduate studies in 2007 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.
