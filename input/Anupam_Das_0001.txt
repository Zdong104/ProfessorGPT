About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at NC State University and a member of the Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR) lab. I am also the director of the IoT Smarthome Lab. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Prior to joining NC State University, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

Research Interests

I conduct research in different aspects of security and privacy with a special focus towards designing secure and privacy-preserving technologies. My current research direction focuses on exploring the security and privacy challenges in the era of Internet of Things (IoT), where I’m focusing on designing systems that can discover, inform and control what information is being shared with different data recipients. The overall goal is to enhance transparency and control for consumers.

[Hiring] I'm looking to hire motivated students to work together on emerging security and privacy problems. Especically if you have experience is developing VR games.
