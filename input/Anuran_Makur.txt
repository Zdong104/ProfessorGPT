Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering
Purdue University

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science (CS) and the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University, where I am also affiliated with the Institute for Control, Optimization and Networks (ICON). Previously, I completed my Sc.D. from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was also a postdoctoral researcher in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT.

research interests

I am broadly interested in theoretical EECS areas. In particular, my research interests are in:

Theory of Machine Learning
ranking and preference learning
optimization for machine learning
non-parametric and high-dimensional inference

Information Theory
information measures and inequalities
fundamental limits of permutation channels and networks
information theoretic methods for statistical inference

Applied Probability
broadcasting on graphs
interacting particle systems
reliable computation using noisy circuits
