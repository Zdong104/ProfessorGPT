Description: Aravind Srinivasan
Hi, welcome to my home-page. I am a Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Computer Science, UMIACS, and AMSC, at the University of Maryland, College Park.

Brief bio: Aravind Srinivasan's main research-interests are in algorithms, probabilistic methods, data science, network science, and machine learning: theory, and applications in areas including health, E-commerce, cloud computing, Internet advertising, and fairness. They span areas including:

Algorithms, probabilistic methods, and continuous/combinatorial optimization;
The interface of algorithms, AI, and machine learning in:
Data science and health: incl. computational epidemiology, (cancer) genomics, pharmacology, organ exchange, and medical devices.
Data science and the Internet economy: incl. E-commerce, digital marketing, cloud optimization, crowdsourcing, and social networks.
Data science and fairness: systematically incorporating (probabilistic, per-user/demographic) fairness in AI and in algorithms.
Algorithms in networking (wireless and peer-to-peer), social networks, and distributed/parallel computing;
Computational approaches to sustainable growth (incl. energy, monitoring and sensing, electric-power and water networks).
Dr. Srinivasan received his PhD from Cornell University, and Bachelor's from IIT Madras. He is an elected Fellow of six professional societies: ACM, IEEE, AMS, AAAS, EATCS, and SIAM. He has been elected a Member of Academia Europaea, the Academy of Europe. He was appointed a Distinguished University Professor of the University of Maryland in 2020: this is the highest academic honor the university confers upon its faculty. He received a Distinguished Alumnus Award from his alma mater IIT Madras. He also received the Distinguished Faculty Award from the Board of Visitors of the College of Computing, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences (University of Maryland). He is a recipient of the Dijkstra Prize, the Danny Lewin Award, and the Distinguished Career Award in Computer Science from the Washington Academy of Sciences.

His past/current research has been funded by research awards from Adobe, Amazon, and Google, and by grants/contracts from the NSF, IARPA, and USARO. He serves as Associate Editor for the ACM Transactions on Algorithms (Editor-in-Chief, 2014-2020), as an Editor for Theory of Computing (Managing Editor, 2006-2019), and as an Editor for the Journal of the IISc.

Srinivasan has also been serving as an Amazon Scholar since 2019.
