Harvard University

I am Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University. I am a member of the EconCS Group; I am also affiliated with the Center for Research on Computation and Society, the Harvard Data Science Initiative, the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, the Institute for Quantitative Social Science and the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications.

I work on a broad and dynamic set of problems related to AI, algorithms, economics, and society. I am especially excited about projects that involve both interesting theory and direct applications; examples include the websites Spliddit and Panelot, as well as recent collaborations with nonprofit organizations such as Refugees.AI, 412 Food Rescue, and the Sortition Foundation.

ABSTRACT

Sortition is a storied paradigm of democracy built on the idea of choosing representatives through lotteries instead of elections. In recent years this idea has found renewed popularity in the form of citizens’ assemblies, which bring together randomly selected people from all walks of life to discuss key questions and deliver policy recommendations. A principled approach to sortition, however, must resolve the tension between two competing requirements: that the demographic composition of citizens’ assemblies reflect the general population and that every person be given a fair chance (literally) to participate. I will describe our work on designing, analyzing and implementing randomized participant selection algorithms that balance these two requirements. I will also discuss practical challenges in sortition based on experience with the adoption and deployment of our open-source system, Panelot.
