Research

My research interests are in Machine Learning, Artificial Intellgence, and Data Mining. My current work focuses on computational and statistical aspects of over-parameterized models including deep learning and generative models. I am also interested in sequential decision making problems.

I also work on applications of machine learning and data sciences in complex real world learning problems including problems in Climate Sciences, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Recommendation Systems, and Finance, among others.

Here is a list of our Publications.

Prospective Students: We are looking for strong PhD students, both in core Machine Learning (ML) and application of ML to scientific problems. Please look through our Research and recent Publications to get a sense of our work.
