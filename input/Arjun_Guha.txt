About

I have broad research interests in programming languages, systems, and software engineering. For the past few years, my group has been working on language design problems that arise in WebAssembly, program synthesis for robot control programs, and developing Code LLMs for low-resource programming languages and novel tasks.

I teach a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses. I have been the lead instructor for Northeastern's CS1 course several times, designed several new courses, and taught graduate seminars on topics as varied as Code LLM development and program verification.

I also serve as the Area Chair for Software at Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Sciences.

Fall 2024 special topics: Engineering LLM-Integrated Systems
