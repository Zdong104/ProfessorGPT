How do we help humans work with data better, faster, and more effectively? Arnab's work focuses on bridging human interaction and data infrastructure, spanning areas of database systems, human-in-the-loop data analytics, and next-generation query interfaces. Arnab is a recipient of the US National Science Foundation's CAREER Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, and IEEE's TCDE Early Career Award for his contributions towards user-focused data interaction. Closer to home, Arnab received the University's Alumni Award for Distinguished Teaching, and the Early Career Innovator of the Year Award, and was also listed as Columbus Business First's "40 under 40". At Ohio State, he co-founded the OHI/O Program, that fosters a tech culture through hackathons and informal learning, and The STEAM Factory, an interdisciplinary research and collaboration network. Most recently, Arnab was founder and CEO of Mobikit, a connected vehicles data analytics startup that was acquired by Azuga Inc., a Bridgestone company. Arnab is an ACM Distinguished Member and holds a PhD in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Michigan.
