I investigate computational methods to discover socially-beneficial knowledge from text and social networks. Examples include tracking diseases, measuring effectiveness of public health campaigns, informing crisis response, preventing online harassment, detecting deceptive marketing, and identifying unsafe products.

The methods rely on machine learning, natural language processing, and social network analysis. Areas of technical contribution include domain adaptation, learning from label proportions, and causal inference.

I also lead the Tulane Center for Community-Engaged Artificial Intelligence and the Jurist Center for Artificial Intelligence.
