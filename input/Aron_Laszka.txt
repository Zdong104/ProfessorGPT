AI FOR EQUITABLE AND RESILIENT FOOD DISTRIBUTION DURING DISASTERS

Food insecurity is the lack of consistent and reliable access to nutritious food. In the Houston (Texas) area, over 14% of Harris County households experienced food insecurity before the emergence of COVID-19.

EQUITABLE ELECTRIC MOBILITY: SMART CHARGING AND SMART PARKING

This Houston-based project establishes a collaborative process with community and commercial technology partners to accelerate the equitable development of accessible fast charging infrastructure and electric vehicle (EV) ownership for low income families by leveraging regional markets of early EV adopters.

AI-ENGINE FOR OPTIMIZING MIXED-FLEET TRANSIT OPERATIONS

In every public transit system, a trade-off has to be made between concentrating service into very useful routes that serve large numbers of people and spreading service out to ensure that people everywhere have access to at least some service.

MICROTRANSIT SOLUTIONS FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

Public transportation infrastructure is an essential component in cultivating equitable communities. However, public transit agencies have historically struggled to achieve this since they are often severely stressed in terms of resources as they have to make the trade-off between concentrating service into routes that serve large numbers of people and spreading service out to ensure that people everywhere have access to at least some service.

ADDRESSING TRANSIT ACCESSIBILITY CHALLENGES DUE TO COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only disrupted the lives of millions but also created exigent operational and scheduling challenges for public transit agencies. Agencies are struggling to maintain transit accessibility with reduced resources, changing ridership patterns, vehicle capacity constraints due to social distancing, and reduced services due to driver unavailability.

BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS

This project studies the following research topics: Security of blockchain-based consensus protocols Secure smart contracts Applications of blockchains

EFFICIENT AND SCALABLE BUG-BOUNTY PROGRAMS

Many organizations and companies have recently chosen to use so-called bug-bounty programs (also known as vulnerability reward programs), which allow outside security experts to evaluate the security of an organization’s products and services and to report security vulnerabilities in exchange for rewards.

DATA-DRIVEN ENERGY OPTIMIZATION FOR MULTI-MODAL TRANSIT

The goal of this project is to develop a high-resolution system-level data capture and analysis framework to revolutionize the operational planning of a regional transportation authority, specifically the Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA).

BLOCKCHAINS FOR TRANSACTIVE ENERGY SYSTEMS

Due to rapid growth in renewable energy resources and improvements in battery technology, power grids are undergoing major changes, which create significant management and control challenges. To tackle these challenges, decentralized solutions are needed, which can support the evolution of electrical power distribution systems.

CORRECT-BY-DESIGN BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SMART CONTRACTS

The adoption of blockchain based distributed ledgers is growing fast due to their ability to provide reliability, integrity, and auditability without trusted entities. One of the key capabilities of these emerging platforms is the ability to create self-enforcing smart contracts.
