Description: Ashok Cutkosky
	I am an assistant professor at Boston University in the ECE department since the fall of 2020.
Previously, I was a research scientist at Google. I earned a PhD in computer science at Stanford University in 2018 under the supervision of Kwabena Boahen, and a AB in mathematics from Harvard in 2013. I am also a master of medicine.
I'm currently excited about optimization algorithms for machine learning. I have recently worked on non-convex optimization as well as adaptive online learning.
My email address is ashok (at) cutkosky (dot) com.

In 2023 I achieved my stretch-goal for academic productivity: I became too lazy to keep this list updated regularly. If it looks out of date, please check out my google scholar profile. Try sorting by year rather than citation to see what I've been working on recently.
