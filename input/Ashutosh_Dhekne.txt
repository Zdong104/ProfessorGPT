Sustainability

	
My work touches upon several aspects of sutainability.
I am a part of Georgia Tech's Sustainability Next committee.
Research projects that contribute to the 17 UN SDGs are indicated using individual SDG icons.
We have made research contributions in the following areas:
   
I am honored to be selected BBISS Faculty Fellow, 2023
I am honored to be selected to the inaugural cohort of Energy Equity, Environmental Justice & Community Engagement Faculty Fellows, 2023


Tiny Data
Several of our projects culminate into the theme of Tiny Data. At a high level, it is the idea that even a miniscule amount of data of the right kind can enable important applications. A 10-minute presentation about Tiny Data is here.

Internships
NEC Labs,
Summer 2018	
Multilateration from moving anchors
In this work we investigate if localization can be performed even when the anchors are mobile. It has applications in various scenarios‚Äîmilitary troops storming an enemy building, fire-fighters putting out fire sources inside buildings, search and rescue, etc. Resulted in the NSDI 2019 paper.
	


Intel Labs,
Summer 2016	
Tracking a game of cricket‚Äîball and players
A cricket ball embedded with UWB sensors was tracked using two anchors placed at the two wickets on a cricket field. The ranging protocol was improved to support about 150Hz update rate. The fast moving ball and players were tracked using a MIMO UWB device. Resulted in the NSDI 2017 paper.
	


Zendrive,
Summer 2015	
Mode of commute categorization using mobile IMU data
Zendrive enables automatic rating driving quality for all drivers of taxi-fleets.
In this work, a mobile device's IMU data was used to distinguish between various modes of transportation. This enables tracking people's activities and provide better context to Zendrive's mobile App. Thus, a person's mountain-biking does not affect her driving record.
	


Avaya,
2005-2006	
Outlook plugin for automatic issue tracking
Avaya's internal teams frequently send emails about product issues to each other. The contents were eventually manually copied into an issue tracking system. We automated this process using an Outlook plugin that detected issue related emails and offered to post the contents in the system. This system continued to be used at Avaya for 6 years after our internship.
	


Work Experience
Securifi,
April 2013 - June 2014	
End-to-end home automation
Enabled home automation on Almond+ routers (router to cloud interface).
Mentored a team of engineers for database design, handling router-to-cloud communication,
Android/iOS mobile Apps, and web application.
This work delivered the Almond+ to thousands of kickstarter backers.
	


Intel,
July 2009 - April 2013	
Wireless display and power saving for Windows graphics driver
Selected for the prestigious Rotation Engineer program offering three rotations through various departments.
Enabled key features of the Intel Graphics Driver for Windows 7, 8.
Explored Intel WiDi for Clover trail, enabled DPST for Bay trail (Android).
Awarded GRA award for 100% Microsoft WHQL certification of Intel's graphics driver.
	




Blogs
Ultra-Wideband Radio Technology,
2021	Exploring UWB
This blog describes some of the important aspects of UWB. If you are interested in UWB research, this blog is a good starting point.

Madwifi,
2009	Enabling TDMA on the Madwifi wireless driver
During our work on long-distance wireless networks, we performed significant changes to the open source Madwifi driver to disable usual CSMA capability and instead send and receive wireless packets at exact intervals. Most of these ideas remain applicable even in the latest Atheros drivers and the blog is a good starting point for understanding wireless buffer flow inside the driver.

Miscellaneous Experiments of a PhD Student,
2015	Titbits on wireless drivers, sensing, and ranging
Details about a project's engineering aspects sometimes do not find a place in publications. Yet, engineering is indeed required to build full working systems that demonstrate the underlying principles. This blog is a catch-all that attempts to bring such experiences under one roof.
