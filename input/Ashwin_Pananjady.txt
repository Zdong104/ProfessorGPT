about

I am an Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech jointly appointed between the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I study problems that fall under the broad umbrella of the mathematics of data science, including high-dimensional statistics and probability, optimization, information theory, signal processing, and reinforcement learning. I am particularly interested in statistical and computational problems arising from geometric structure in high dimensions.

Before starting at Georgia Tech in January 2021, I spent a semester as a research fellow at the Simons Institute. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from UC Berkeley, where I was advised by Martin Wainwright and Tom Courtade. Before that, I got my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras.
