About: I am directing the Laboratory for Ubiquitous and Intelligent Sensing (UIS Lab) at Syracuse University. My research takes a multi-disciplinary approach to developing novel and practical human-centric computing and sensing solutions. My research interests go beyond the conventional learning or sensing approaches and address the research challenges, such as:

Investigating the natural distribution shifts within real human-centric applications, understanding their impact, and developing solutions to attain robustness against these shifts.
Addressing issues of Fairness and bias mitigation in human-centric computing, especially in scenarios where the factors subject to inequitable treatment remain unidentified.
Multimodal-integration and Co-teaching-based ubiquitous and human-centric computing solutions.
Interpretability of ML inference, particularly in the context of healthcare applications.
Scalable and compressed ubiquitous computing solutions addressing the challenges of resource-constraint edge computing platforms.
Trustworthiness and reliability in automated human-centric sensing, computing, and actuation/intervention.
Addressing the privacy and security challenges associated with human-centric computing, sensing, and Internet-of-things (IoT) applications.

A core focus of my research program is to integrate computing solutions to advance health assessment, identify latent markers, automate health monitoring, and facilitate automated interventions. My recent and ongoing projects include real-world health applications, such as

Passive assessment of mental health (e.g., depression, social anxiety disorder, PTSD, etc.) and affective states.
Automated assessment of opioid craving in opioid-use-disorder (OUD) individuals and providing reliable, trustworthy, and just-in-time interventions to mitigate craving.
Understanding mental, speech, and sensorimotor factors of children-stuttering and providing automated interventions.
Automated assessment of socio-behavioral well-being of dairy cattle and providing adaptive just-in-time interventions to the farmers.
Automated monitoring of asthma and dementia patients.
Predicting COVID-19 mortality, risk factors, and its effect on mental health.
Identify, visualize, and interpret health-related (for Autism, Alzheimer's, and PTSD) atypical brain-activity patterns from EEG, MRI (fMRI), and fNIRS signals, etc.
Identifying markers of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Starting in 2023, I have taken on the role of Associate Editor (AE) for the journal 'The Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT)' and the prestigious 'UbiComp' conference, which is the leading publication platform for ubiquitous computing research. Additionally, since 2021, I have been serving as an Associate Editor (AE) for the 'ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare' journal.

Affiliations: I am affiliated with Aging Studies Institute, Syracuse University , and an Assistant Professor (voluntary track) at SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA.

Announcements! I am seeking motivated Ph.D. students. Interested students should email their curriculum vitae, transcripts, and a paragraph or two detailing their research experiences, with the subject as 'Ph.D. admission at Syracuse University.'

Research Interests
Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Wireless, Connected and Mobile Health.
