Research
I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science and belong to the Algorithms and Theory group at UB.
Of late I am also interested in questions at the intersection of computing and society and belong to the Computing for Social Good group at UB.
Theory Seminar

Specific topics of interest include structured linear algebra (with applications in machine learning), database algorithms, theory of error-correcting codes, algorithms and society.

    Publications (DBLP listing, Google Scholar profile).


A Science Magazine article on list and local decoding of error correcting codes.
Slides from my CSE501 Research Overview talk.
Thesis (Co-winner, William Chan Memorial Dissertation Award, 2007) .
