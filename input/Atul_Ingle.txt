Imagine a camera with orders of magnitude higher dynamic range than the human eye. Imagine a camera that can capture laser-scan quality 3D structuresÂ fromÂ several miles away. Imagine a camera that can "see" inside the human body without invasive surgical procedures.

â€‹

I design cameras of the future that can visualize structures and phenomena that are otherwise invisible to the human eye.

â€‹

My research is in the field of computational imaging, at the intersection of optics, image sensors, signal processing, and machine learning. Recently, I have been working with single-photon avalanche diodes, an extremely sensitive sensor technology capable of detecting ultra-lowÂ intensity light, down to individual photons.

â€‹

This technology has implications for myriadÂ applicationsâ€”from astronomy to microscopy, consumer photography toÂ medical imaging, fromÂ autonomous driving to industrial machine vision.

Bio

â€‹

â€‹I received the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015. I was a visiting ultrasound R&D engineer at Philips Healthcare in Andover, MA in 2013 and 2014 and a Research Scientist at Fitbit, Inc. in Boston, MA in 2016-2017. From 2017-2021, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the WISION Lab and Computational Imaging Lab at UW-Madison. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Portland State University. My research interests include computational imaging and signal processing.

Recent Projects

Some of my recent work focuses onÂ single-photon computational imaging.Â Single-photon cameras are an emerging sensor technology with extremeÂ sensitivityÂ down to individual photons.Â They have the potential to enable extreme imaging applications that areÂ beyond the capabilities of conventional cameras.

Extreme Dynamic Range Imaging with SPADs

CVPR 2021Â oral presentation

Single-photon sensors are typically used in active imaging applications like LiDAR. We ask: what information can single-photon sensors provide forÂ passive imaging? We show that the picosecond resolution timing information can provide extreme dynamic range, over a million-to-one.

Single-Photon 3D Imaging

ICCV 2019 Marr Prize Honorable Mention

Extreme sensitivity is a double-edged sword. Single-photon detectorsÂ suffer from severe distortion when operated in bright sunlight; they get overwhelmed by background photons. We develop optimal data acquisition strategies that mitigate this distortionÂ and enable high resolution 3D imaging even underÂ bright sunlight.

Single-Photon LiDAR in High Ambient Light

CVPR 2019 oral presentation

What is the optimal photon flux condition a single-photon LiDAR should be operated in? We answer this question theoretically and also build a hardware prototype to show improved 3D reconstruction performance.
