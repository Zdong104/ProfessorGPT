Open Office Hours
I have open office hours, primarily intended for Ph.D. students in CSE at UM (you do not have to be my student to see me). They can be used for just getting acquainted, general career discussion, chat about research, dealing with challenges in doing a Ph.D., or anything else. To reserve a slot, please book here. Reach me on email or Google chat if needed.
Research Interests
Security and privacy of emerging systems including cyber-physical systems, efficient and secure machine learning.
Bio
My CV
Teaching
I have taught many software systems and security courses at Michigan including operating systems, database systems, and computer and network security. At the undergraduate level, in recent years, I have taught EECS 484, our database systems course.

At the graduate level, I am currently developing a new course on trustworthy machine learning with my Ph.D. students, Ryan Feng, Elisa Tsai, and Haizhong Zheng. See material from some recent offerings of the course below. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in exchanging ideas on such a course.

Adversarial Machine Learning (Winter 2021)
Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (Winter 2023)
Participating in my group
To apply to do independent study research in my group, drop me an email with your CV and transcript, and preliminary thoughts on what you would like to work on. I am happy to work with both undergraduate and graduate students, though openings tend to be limited. Ideally, you should be available for more than one semester.

IoT Security Research

See this page for research in our group on IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems. Some recent work includes research on robust physical perturbation attacks on machine learning classifers (CVPR 2018), defense mechanisms to make OAuth tokens at trigger-action cloud services such as IFTTT less risky (NDSS 2018), security analysis of SmartThings IoT application platform (IEEE S&P 2016), and ContexIoT, an automatic IoT app patching mechanism to help enforce context-based permissions (NDSS 2017).

Data Privacy Research
With Facebook privacy issues in the news, revisit our 2008 CSCW paper that warned of some of the risks of access to social network data and also outlined some defense strategies: Social Networks and Context-Aware Spam
