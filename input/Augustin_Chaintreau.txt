Research Interests

I design algorithms and mathematical analysis of networks. The goal of my research is to reconcile the benefits of leveraging personal data and social networks with a commitment to fairness and privacy. Latest results of my research address transparency in personalization, fairness in personal data markets, efficiency of crowdsourced content curation, and privacy of users across several domains.
