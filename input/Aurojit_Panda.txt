I am an assistant professor in Computer Science at NYU. Previously, I received my PhD from UC Berkeley where I was advised by Scott Shenker and worked in the NetSys Lab. Even earlier, I received a Sc.B. with honors in Math-CS from Brown.

My research interests lie in finding lightweight mechanisms for achieving correctness in systems (broadly defined). My dissertation looked at how to implement and execute network functions; and how to verify correctness for NFV (network function virtualization) deployments. A selection of past projects and publications can be found on this site.

Before starting at NYU, I spent a year as a software developer at Nefeli Networks, a startup focused on solutions for Network Function orchestration. Between Brown and Berkeley I spent a few years working on the Midori kernel at Microsoft.

Working with me

I am always interested in finding students to work with me. At present (late 2022) my main interests are in (a) checking that distributed systems are executing correctly (see here for a very high-level overview); (b) in programming frameworks that make it easier to offload logic to the operating system and SmartNICs (see Bertha, Kopi and Menshen below); (c) in enforcing richer polices in distributed applications; (d) in developing tools for debugging machine learning models and tooling (see our ICML paper on Enola); and (e) in debugging and reasoning about distributed applications. That said, I tend to work on any problem that seems interesting, and am happy to work outside of these areas.

Note that I cannot respond to most e-mails asking me to evaluate your application, and I suggest that you just apply.
