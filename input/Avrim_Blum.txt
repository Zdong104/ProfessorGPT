Description: 	
Avrim Blum
Professor of Computer Science
School of Computer Science

On August 1, 2017 I joined TTI-Chicago as its new CAO. My new homepage is http://www.ttic.edu/blum.
My new email address is [firstname] at ttic.edu.
My main research interests are in machine learning theory, approximation algorithms, on-line algorithms, algorithmic game theory / mechanism design, the theory of database privacy, and non-worst-case analysis of algorithms. Some time ago I also did work in AI Planning.

I am on the organizing committee for the STOC 2017 Theory Fest, the STOC 2017 Workshop Program, and was recently on Program Committees for STOC 2016 and COLT 2014. I also co-organized the STOC 2013 Workshop on New (Theoretical) Challenges in Machine Learning. and was co-PI for the Indo-US Joint Center for Advanced Research in Machine Learning, Game Theory, and Optimization. For more information on my research, see the publications and research interests links below. My home department is the CMU Computer Science Department, but I am also affiliated with the CMU Machine Learning Department. I am additionally a member of the CS Theory Group.
