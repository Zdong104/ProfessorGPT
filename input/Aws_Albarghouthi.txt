Description: Aws Albarghouthi
Associate Professor
Computer Sciences
UW–Madison



I study the art and science of program synthesis and verification. My group is currently focused on two problems: a) automatically synthesizing compilers for quantum computers and b) certifying robustness and fairness of machine learning. I'm always looking for ambitious students.

I'm currently on leave at AWS (I know, hilarious).

🍉 The name  ·  أوس البرغوثي

My first name rhymes with house—i.e., pronounced ouse. Aws is an ancient Arabic word for wolf. See, for example, this Graeco-Arabic inscription.

My last name is pronounced Al·bər·go͞o·tē (or Bər·go͞o·tē). Albarghouthi is a Palestinian family from the village of Deir Ghassaneh, about 20 miles north of Jerusalem and east of Jaffa.
