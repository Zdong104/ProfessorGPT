About Me

I am an Associate Professor of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta. I received a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh in 2012, and a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay in 2007. Short third-person bio can be found HERE. My CV is here: PDF.


          
Research Interests
If you are interested in joining the group: Thank you for your interest. Please see this first.



How do you forecast pandemics? How you do distribute resources to stop an outbreak as fast as possible? How do failures in power grids cascade? I am broadly interested in Data Science, Machine Learning and AI with emphasis on solving big-data problems in networks and sequences. Many of the research questions I answer deal with understanding and managing efficiently, dynamical mechanisms (like propagation) on networks, occurring across natural, social and technological systems. These include problems motivated from public health, computational epidemiology, cybersecurity, urban computing and the web. My research combines theoretical analysis of models, developing efficient algorithms and empirical studies on large scale data.

My advisor at CMU was Prof. Christos Faloutsos. Earlier at IIT Bombay, my advisor was Prof. S. Sudarshan where I worked on Query Optimization.
