I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at UCLA, where I lead the BigML research group.

My research aims to address sustainability, reliability, and efficiency of machine learning. I am mainly working on improving the big data quality, by developing theoretically rigorous methods to select the most beneficial data for efficient and robust learning. Besides, I am also interested in improving the models and learning algorithms. The resulting methods are broadly applicable for learning from massive datasets across a wide range of applications, such as medical diagnosis and environment sensing.

Before joining UCLA, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in Computer Science at Stanford University working with Jure Leskovec. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from ETH Zurich advised by Andreas Krause. I received an ETH medal for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis, was selected as a Rising Star in EECS by MIT, and received an NSF Career Award.
