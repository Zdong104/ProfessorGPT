Barna Saha

Director of the National NSF TRIPODS Institute for Emerging CORE Methods in Data Science (EnCORE)

The Harry E. Gruber Endowed Chair Professor of Computer Science and Information Technologies, University of California San Diego

Department of Computer Science & Engineering, and Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute

Previously, I was a tenured Associate Professor at the University of California Berkeley, and even before that on the faculty of Computer Science at UMass Amherst, and as a Senior Research Scientist at the AT&T Shannon Research Laboratory. I am also an Affiliate faculty of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley.

Research Interests: My research interests span theoretical computer science specifically algorithm design and fine-grained complexity. Here are some examples of recent questions that I am exploring:

How do we design fast algorithms when the date is changing?
How do we improve complexity of classical problems like edit distance and all pairs shortest paths?
How do we improve efficiency of training and inference of popular AI models?

NEWS!

Director of The National NSF TRIPODS Institute for Emerging CORE Methods in Data Science. One of four in the nation. Led a multi-university team successfully.

Appointed The Harry E. Gruber Endowed Chair Professorship of Computer Science and Information Technologies, UCSD

I am triple tenured :-) if there is any term like that: went through three successful tenure processes: UC Berkeley, UMass Amherst, and UCSD.

Deeply honored to receive a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), 2019. Thanks to the National Science Foundation for the nomination. Here is the white house release. Also see here, here and here. This is what the NSF citation says: "For pioneering a unified theory of fine-grained algorithm design leading to enhanced computation efficiency and practical solutions for a range of problems, and for outstanding dedication to mentoring and training a diverse and interdisciplinary scientific workforce."
