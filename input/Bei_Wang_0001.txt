Research Interests


I am interested in the analysis and visualization of large and complex data.

My research expertise lies in the theoretical, algorithmic, and application aspects of data analysis and data visualization, with a focus on topological techniques. My research interests include: topological data analysis, data visualization, computational topology, computational geometry, machine learning and data mining. Previously, I have worked on projects related to computational biology and bioinformatics, as well as robotics.

My vision is to tackle problems involving large and complex forms of data that require rich structural descriptions, by combining topological, geometric, statistical, data analysis and visualization techniques.

I have a travel blog Jumpy Shell, a travel instagram, and a food blog Bei's Bites, all of which have been more or less inactive because of these kids.
I am married to Jeff M. Phillips, and we have two sons.

I grew up in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.
I came to US after graduating from Chengdu No.7 High School.
My high school celerated its 110 year anniversary in 2015.
Chengdu is a city of gastronomy (as declared by UNESCO in 2011).
It is famous for many things I love, including spicy food, a Giant Sitting Buddha and pandas.
