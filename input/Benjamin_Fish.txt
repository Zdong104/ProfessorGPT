I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I develop methods for incorporating human values into machine learning and other computational systems. I am also interested in the theory of machine learning and the study of large networks. I was previously at Mila and Microsoft Research, and completed my PhD at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
