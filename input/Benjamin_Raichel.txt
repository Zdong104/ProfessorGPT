I am currently looking for motivated students to work on algorithms research.
If you are interested, read this before contacting me.

Hi, welcome to my page. I am an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at UT Dallas. My research interests lie broadly in Computer Science Theory, but primarily I work on problems in Computational Geometry and Geometric Approximation Algorithms.

Current Students:
Md. Billal Hossain (PhD)
Jonathan James Perry (PhD)
Graduated:
Chenglin Fan (PhD)
Hongyao Huang (PhD)
Georgiy Klimenko (PhD)
Gregory Van Buskirk (PhD)
Teaching:
Advanced Algorithm Design and Analysis: CS 4349 (Spring 2024)
Funding:
NSF CAREER: Giving Form to Data with a Geometric Scafold
NSF CRII: Breaking Barriers for Geometric Data

My PhD advisor was Sariel Har-Peled. Here is a copy of my CV, and here is a sneezing bear.
