About

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and human-centered design. My group develops methods for responsible machine learning in medicine, consumer finance, and the physical sciences. We focus on topics like algorithmic fairness, interpretability, and personalization.

Previously, I held research positions at Google AI and at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society. I also co-founded Petal, a company that uses machine learning to broaden credit access. I received a PhD in Computer Science from MIT, and Bachelors degrees in Operations Research and Economics from UC Berkeley.
