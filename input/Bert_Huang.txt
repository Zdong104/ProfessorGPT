About Me

Previously, I was an assistant professor in the Tufts University Department of Computer Science and the Data Intensive Studies Center. I investigate machine learning with a special focus on incorporating human knowledge into algorithms to make them more reliable, efficient, and fair. This page is out-of-date. Stay tuned for an update in the near future.

Hobbies
Music

When I have free time, I try my best to be a musician. Lately, this is mostly manifested by my playing guitar to entertain my pet budgie.

In graduate school, I created a few recordings experimenting with the electronic instruments built into Apple GarageBand for iPad, which can be streamed from my SoundCloud page.

In my early high school years, I arranged a number of electronic pieces. Later, in high school and college, I explored combining my electronic songs with real voice and instrument recordings (here is a small subset).

Athletics

During graduate school, I earned a brown belt studying with the Columbia University Tae Kwon Do Club.
