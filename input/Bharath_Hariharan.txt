Description: Bharath Hariharan

I am an associate professor in Computer Science at Cornell University. I work on computer vision and machine learning, in particular on important problems that defy the "Big Data" label. I enjoy problems that require marrying advances in machine learning with insights from computer vision, geometry and domain-specific knowledge. A sampling of the research problems my group works on is presented below; an exhaustive list of publications is available on scholar.


My work has been recognized with an NSF CAREER award and a PAMI Young Researcher Award.

My CV is here and my research statement is here.

Research


Recognition for satellite images and earth science
A variety of scientific disciplines, including environmental science and the earth sciences, need to know what is there in any place on the planet at any time. This requires recognition on satellite images as well as combining information from multiple modalities (satellite, aerial and ground) captured at the same location. Recognition on satellite images is in itself also a fundamental challenge given the absence of large labeled datasets. As part of this project, we have built one of the most accurate foundation vision-language model for satellite images as well as new self-supervised representations for satellite images.	

4D Reconstruction and recognition
Humans live in a 4D world: we do not perceive independent static images, but rather a continuous video stream. On the one hand, ego-motion in video provides enough information to reconstruct the static scene and segment the moving objects, which can power recognition. On the other hand, videos depict dynamic scenes and moving objects introduce fundamental ambiguities and challenges with occlusion. Our work has shown how one can resolve ambiguities to reconstruct and segment out moving objects, as well as track surfaces through occlusion.
