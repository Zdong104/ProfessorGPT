Talks and Videos

	 	

The video above left features former Ph.D. students from my research group talking about their experiences on the occassion of our 10th anniversary celebrations last year. Above right is a short pitch about my group's research at EmTech MIT 2011, focusing on our collaboration with GM Research on vehicular networks, which was featured in the TR-35 list.


The Dangers of Classroom Teaching, transcript of a talk I gave at the ASEE Frontiers in Engineering Conference, Arlington, VA, October 28, 2010.
