My group works on machine learning for natural language processing and knowledge representation. I completed my PhD in 2020 from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. My thesis advisers were William Cohen and Russ Salakhutdinov. Before that I did Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur, where I worked with Amitabha Mukerjee. In between I worked at Qualcomm Research in San Diego, USA.


Current topics of interest include:

Question answering and information retrieval
Logical and temporal reasoning over structured and unstructured knowledge
Robustness to corrupted text inputs
Misinformation / propaganda detection
Model calibration for inherently subjective NLP tasks

Prospective students
PhD applicants: Please apply to the Duke CS PhD program here (next deadline is Dec 15). I am currently looking for students to join my group. Please only email if you have questions which are not answered here, I may not be able to respond to all emails.
Undergraduate or masters students at Duke: If you are interested in working with me, please send an email describing your background and what specifically you want to work on. Include your transcript and also mention how much time will you be able to commit to the project.
Others: Please note that at this point I have limited bandwidth to advise students not currently at Duke. However, if you think you are a very good fit please send an email describing your background and what you want to work on. Please only email if you have significant prior experience in NLP or ML.
