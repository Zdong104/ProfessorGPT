Bijaya Adhikari, Ph.D.
Assistant Professor
Biography
Research Interests

My research interest lies in data mining and machine learning, with a focus on dynamical processes (e.g. spread of misinformation, diseases, failures) on large networks (e.g. web, population contact networks, critical infrastructures). My recent work include AI for influenza forecasting, e-commerce search and fraud detection, outbreak detection in hospitals, network embedding, community detection, and network summarization.

As a member of the Computational Epidemiology Group, I primarily investigate problems motivated by public health such as propagation of diseases via contact network, forecasting outbreaks of infectious diseases, and designing optimal surveillance systems.
