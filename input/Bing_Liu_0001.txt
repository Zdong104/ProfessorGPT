Research Projects
Opinion Mining, Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Spam Detection
Book: Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining: Introduction and survey
Emotional chatbot - enable chatbots or dialogue systems to converse with emotions
Reviews Reading Comprehension: Answer questions using reviews - When you plan to buy a product, do you have questions? Yes, 100%.
Lifelong Machine Learning - Continual Learning. An Interview in Nature Outlook.
Continual Learning, and Continuous Learning: Learn like humans - accumulating the prevously learned knowledge and adapt/transfer it to help future learning.
New Survey: Continual Learning of Natural Language Processing Tasks: A Survey. arXiv:2211.12701, 11/23/2022.
Continual Pre-training of Language Models and Cruise - Cross-system Architecture Design for Automous Wireless Networks based on Lifelong Machine Learning.
Autonomous Learning Agents or On-the-Job Continual Learning After Model Deployment for Autonomous and Interactive AI Systems.
AI Autonomy: AI agents learn on their own continuously after deployment. Learning is self-motivated and self-initiated.
Interactive AI. The key to autonomous learning is to learn by the agent itself through self-initiated interactions with humans, other agents and the environment.
NSF AI Institute: ACTION - Agent-based Cyber Threat Intelligence and Operation.
Lifelong and Continual Learning Dialogue Systems
SIGIR-2022 and IJCAI-2021 Tutorial: Continual Learning Dialogue System - Learning after Model Deployment.
New Book: "Lifelong and Continual Learning Dialogue Systems." by Sahisnu Mazumder and Bing Liu, Feb 2024.
Open World Machine Learning, Classification or Recognition (a.k.a., Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection) to achieve AI Autonomy.
Closed world assumption: classic machine learning assumes that test instances must be from training classes. Not true in many real-world environments.
Open-world learning: It involves novelty (out-of-distribution) dection, characterization, adaptation and continual learning of novelty/new classes.


Earlier projects (inactive currently)
PU Learning - Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Examples (Set Expansion is also a form of PU learning)
Detect Fake Reviews and Fake Reviewers - Detect Opinion Spam
Detecting fake or deceptive opinions on review sites, facebook, Twitter, Weibo, and forum discussion sites
Intent Mining - Mining user Intents or Intentions in Social Media Posts
Chapter 11 of my sentiment analysis book discusses this topic; also see this NAACL-HLT-2013 paper.
Generate a Book Automatically using Web Content: Synthesize knowledge on the Web (See our WWW-2003 paper).
Given a topic, discover sub-topics and related concepts, and synthesize information from multiple Web pages to present a coherent and fairly complete picture of the topic.
Web Data Extraction from Flat/Nested Data Records - Web page template detection and noise removal
Download MDR; Two new systems are DEPTA and NET.
Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
Diagnostic Data Mining - Interestingness of Knowledge: Finding interesting and actionable knowledge.
We built a system in 2006, called Opportunity Map (also known as OM in Motorola). It was deployed in 2006 and is still in regular use in Motorola. Motorola has sold copies of the system to some Telco companies. There is also a patent, but unfortunately it is owned by Motorola, not us :-(.
Classification Based on Associations - Integrating Classification and Association Rule Mining
Download CBA - asociation rules based classification. You can also use the CBA implementation of Frans Coenen from Univesity of Livepool.
KDD-98 paper and others (KDD-99, PKDD-00, etc)
Association rule mining with multiple minimum supports
Interestingness: subjective interestingness, rule summary, rule query language, change mining
