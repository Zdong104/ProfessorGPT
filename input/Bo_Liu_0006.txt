I am a senior scientist at Amazon.com. My current research focus centers around Trustworthy AI (such as interpretable AI, safe and risk-aware AI, fairness in AI, etc.), Interactive Machine Learning (such as reinforcement learning, human-aided learning), and Neural-Symbolic AI (such as neural-symbolic rule synthesis and analysis). Previously I worked in the Autonomous Learning lab at UMass Amherst, working closely with Prof. Sridhar Mahadevan and Prof. Andy Barto. I also worked with Prof. Rich Sutton in the summer of 2018.

One postdoc position is available, click here for details.
