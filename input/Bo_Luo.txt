Research

My current research interests lie in the intersection of security and privacy and data science. In particular, I'm interested in:
          •   Adversarial machine learning
          •   Information and system security
          •   IoT/CPS and hardware-enabled security
          •   Privacy, online social networks

We are looking for self-motivated students who are interested in academic research on information security. If you are interested in this opportunity or if you have questions, please drop me an email: bluo <at> ku <dot> edu.

I'm serving as the general co-chair of ACM CCS 2024. Submit your paper and/or join us in Salt Lake City!

I am the PI of Jayhawk SFS -- CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service program at KU. For more information about the program, please visit Jayhawk SFS program homepage.

I am the director of the High Assurance and Secure Systems (HASS) Research Center at I2S. I2S is a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE/CD) and Research (CAE-R) designated by the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security.
