Welcome to Bo Wu's homepage

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines. My research lies in the broad field of compilers and programming systems, with an emphasis on program optimizations for heterogeneous computing and emerging architectures. My current focus is on building efficient systems for machine learning and graph processing applications.

Before joining Mines in August 2014, I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from The College of William and Mary, where I worked with Professor Xipeng Shen. I received an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics both from Central South University, Hunan, China.

Hobbies

I try my best to play basketball three times a week. I play guitar and piano to entertain myself (not sure whether I'm skilled enough to entertain others). I like history, philosophy, and physics. Last but not least, I was once a pretty good counter strike gamer and played on a team which won a championship in a local league.
