Academic Appointments
Assistant Professor of Computer Science

I develop computational approaches to study complex natural systems and make novel robotic systems. By combining numerical algorithms, applied mathematics, and machine learning techniques, I investigate and develop physical systems that are fluidic, soft, multi-scale, mixed-dimensional, and computation-driven. In particular, I seek to create computer algorithms to unveil the connections between geometry, topology, material, and dynamics of these complex systems.
