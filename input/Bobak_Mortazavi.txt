About Me - Ph.D. Computer Science
I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University, and a member of the Center for Remote Health Technologies & Systems.



I currently have several openings with my group for highly motivated and driven students in all areas of our group's research including: clinical outcomes research, machine learning, embedded systems design, and internet of things research, to name a few! If you are interested in joining the team, please read through

Prior to joining Texas A&M, I was a postdoctoral associate under the supervision of Prof. Harlan Krumholz at the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) and Prof. Sahand Negahban of the Department of Statistics. I worked as a graduate student (and earned my Ph.D.) in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Majid Sarrafzadeh at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Wireless Health Institute (2014). I earned a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Univeristy of California Berkeley (2007).

My research interests include end-to-end research on medical embedded systems and the application of data mining and machine learning algorithms necessary to make personalized, preventative medical treatments possible through advanced health analytics . My background is in embedded systems design, where I studied sensor fusion, reconfigurable architectures and systems, hardware accelerators, and gpu computing. During my Ph.D. I applied data mining and machine learning techniques to these systems to develop a personalized, exercise-level activity-recognition video game with wearable sensors. I am now primarily concerned with the ability to use supervised and unsupervised techniques to learn more about medical prediction and risk-stratification in order to better develop personalized medical systems, prediction models, comparative effectiveness techniques, and combine wearable sensors and other necessary data to make a clinical impact at the system level, provider level, and patient level.

Research

Currently, my interdisciplinary work involves bridging of computer science with the medical research realm, particularly in Patient-Centered Outcomes Research. For example, I have worked on projects ranging from Personalized Activity Recognition for exergaming, exercise repetition, rehabilitation and nutrition monitoring (while at UCLA) to Remote Monitoring and Clinical prediction in clinical settings using Clinical Trial Data, Clinical Registry Data, and Clinical Electronic Health Record Data (while at Yale). These projects investigate system design, user adherence and cheating, risk prediction, comparative effectiveness, and a deeper understanding and evaluation of clinical questions and challenges at a patient-centered outcomes focus.

Detailed Research Projects
My research investigates all aspects of patient-centered end-to-end medical embedded systems, from various sensors and wearable monitoring techniques to algorithms, data mining, and machine learning to process the data generated for different medical applications. These applications range from monitoring information for healthy individuals to adverse event detection of patients in critical care environments. My work, in particular, investigates the processing of real-time time-series processing, from activity recognition to medical event prediction. This includes supervised and unsupervised techniques to better cluster and identify patient types, evaluate the balance between historical data and real-time data, and classification and risk-stratification.

My work is a bridging of statistical inference/computer science and system design techniques with the medical research realm. As these clustering, classification and risk-stratification techniques are improved upon, I look to investigate the user-specific nature of such information, from the data processing to patient identification and adverse event prediction. Ultimately, the end-to-end monitoring systems for preventative medicine need to be personalized to provide the strongest possible care and information to the patient, the clinician, and the clinical care environment.
Machine Learning with Clinical Data: Patient-Centered Risk and Prediction in Clinical Data, Registry Data, and EMR Data
My postdoctoral position in the medical school investigates the application of data analytic techniques to better identify patient types, heterogeneous illness identification, and risk-stratification and prediction on various data sets and on numerous clinical problems. This varies from pristine clinical trial data sets, to comprehensive national cross-sectional data registries, to the real-time data available from the electronic medical records system at the Yale New Haven Hospital system. Data ranges from standard, baseline, cross-sectional data to streaming real-time information at the patient level. This streaming can vary from daily telephone calls, monthly physical exams, and minute-by-minute ICU/EMR data. This project is a componenet of the Big Data To Knowledge innitiative here at Yale to bridge the data sciences with clinical practice and research. We are investigating the implementation of novel techniques to identify sub-phenotypes of patients/disease types to better risk-stratify patients and identify/address adverse events. Our projects investigate risk prediction, comparative effectiveness, and a deeper understanding and evaluation of existing national models on adverse events in registry data and electronic medical record data.




Realistic-Motion Activity Recognition
I am also interested in the application of user-specific models for wearable sensors of various applications. While the medical and heart failure classification project looks at ill patients and readmissions information, patient-centered wearable systems also allow for new systems for healthy individuals. My work investigates systems and algorithms for real-time and near-realistic activity recognition for user-centered sports training, exercise-based video game (exergaming), and the classification of large, multi-class environments of similar movements in a fine-grain, non-cyclical manner. Further, we have investigated, through the use of a pilot clinical trial, the actual caloric expenditure of such a system, developing various regression techniques to determine the exercise effectiveness of the movements.

Rehabilitation Devices, Remote Monitoring of Patients, and Exercise Monitoring
These movements can range from multiple sensors and a gaming environment to exercise repetition counting from a wrist-wearable sensor in a gym environment. Further, we have investigated the use of custom sensors, smart phones, and smart watches in tracking people from healthy individuals to patients in a clinical setting, such as elderly oncology patients and patients in a large heart failure clinical trial, which was a project named Wanda. Further, we looked at trade offs between false positive and false negative rates in such systems, alarm fatigue, and nursing costs in implementing such remote monitoring systems.

Biomedical Signal Search
Another aspect of evaluating medical embedded systems and analytics is information gain in finding similar patients. We looked at ECG patterns and developed a signal search method to find similar heart beat patterns to categorize patients' signals. This form of signal search allows for finding similar but not exact matches in a database without resulting in a significant pruning time for erroneous matches.

Nutrition Monitoring
Our wearable sensors work also extends to nutrition monitoring where we developed a necklace that can detect the types of food you ingest while swallowing, in order to better estimate your caloric intake. While most systems focus on determining caloric expenditure, the need to better automate intake is high.
