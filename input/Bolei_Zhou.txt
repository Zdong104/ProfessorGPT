My research is at the intersection of computer vision and machine autonomy, with a focus on developing interpretable and generalizable embodied AI that aligns with humans. I am also interested in understanding various human-centric properties of current AI models beyond their accuracy, such as explainability, interpretability, steerability, generalization, and safety. Some of the earlier works I co-authored are Class Activation Mapping (CAM), Places, ADE20K, Network Dissection.

See MetaDriverse for recent work on machine autonomy and GenForce for recent work on generative modeling.
