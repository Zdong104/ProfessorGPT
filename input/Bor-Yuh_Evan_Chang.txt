Ph.D. Positions. I am always looking for enthusiastic students interested in working with me on research projects in programming languages and software systems. If you are interested in finding out more, please contact me.

For insight into the Programming Languages and Verification group, take a look at a recent recruiting talk.

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering (by courtesy) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I co-direct the Programming Languages and Verification Group (CUPLV). I am also a Scholar with Amazon.

My research focuses on making software better and programmers more productive by investigating the fundamental principles and techniques needed to algorithmically assist the software developer throughout the software engineering process. Our advances seek to help users better specify what they care about, interact with automated reasoning engines, triage the alarms from tools, and leverage source code repositories to improve their software. This work is often driven the needs of today's real-world applications to ultimately inform tomorrow's designs.

I completed my Ph.D. with George Necula at the University of California, Berkeley and spent a semester as a postdoctoral researcher with Jeffrey S. Foster in the PLUM group at the University of Maryland, College Park before joining the University of Colorado Boulder.
