About Me

I am an Associate Professor in the NC State Department of Computer Science and a member of the Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR) Lab and the Secure Computing Institute.

My research is dedicated to measuring and improving the security and privacy of computer systems, with a particular emphasis on cellular and telephone networks, IP networks, and software security at scale. This work has developed new techniques to understand and prevent robocalls and other telephone fraud, demonstrated the magnitude of leaked credentials in software repositories, and identified systemic risks in developing world mobile money systems. Computer security is inherently interdisciplinary, and my research has used techniques from a wide variety of fields, including: signal processing and digital communications; program analysis and reverse engineering; data science, machine learning, and statistics; applied cryptography; human factors; and Internet, telephone, and wireless networks.
