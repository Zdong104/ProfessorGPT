About

I am an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University. I teach algorithms and data science and my research focuses on algorithmic fairness in artificial intelligence, computational economics, and multi-agent systems. Generally speaking, I am interested in algorithmic problems where agents must reason (and possibly learn) about competing preferences in decision problems or strategic environments. My motivation for this work derives from a desire to generate a more humane society with respect to AI and algorithms that can respond to the complexity of preferences in a rigorous and equitable way. I am broadly interested in computer science education, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
