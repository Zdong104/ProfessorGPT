*I am actively looking for PhD students to join my lab starting Fall 2020. If you are interested, please reach out via email with a resume.*

Brandon Reagen is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering with affiliation appointments in the Computer Science. He earned a PhD in computer science from Harvard in 2018 and received his undergraduate degrees in computer systems engineering and applied mathematics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2012.
 
A computer architect by training, Brandon has a research focus on designing specialized hardware accelerators for applications including deep learning and privacy preserving computation. He has made several contributions to ease the use accelerators as general architectural constructs including benchmarking, simulation infrastructure, and System on a Chip (SoC) design. He has led the way in highly efficient and accurate deep learning accelerator design with his studies of principled unsafe optimizations, and his work has been published in conferences ranging from computer architecture, machine learning, computer aided design, and circuits.
 
Prior to joining NYU, he was a research scientist with Facebook’s AI Infrastructure Research working on privacy preserving machine learning and systems for neural recommendation. During his PhD he was a Siebel Scholar (2018) and was selected as a 2018 Rising Star in Computer Architecture by Georgia Tech.
