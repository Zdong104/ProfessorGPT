Dr. Davison's CV is also available.

Special opportunity for colleagues in industry, government, etc.
Would you be interested in co-advising a doctoral student (who you approve) so that they learn to think in terms of research in your setting, and not just academia? Lehigh has a new program called P3 (Pasteur Partners PhD) that enables such an arrangement with me or my faculty colleagues in any STEM field, focusing on use-inspired research.

A few sayings that I like (the wording is mine, but I've probably picked up the content elsewhere)
Everything in moderation, also known in Latin as Modus omnibus in rebus.
-- Ancient Greek Proverb (the Latin is from Plautus).

Never ascribe to malice what you can ascribe to stupidity -- especially your own.
-- See Hanlon's Razor and M.N. Plano's version

The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men; Gang aft a-gley
-- Robert Burns: To a Mouse (original Scots)

Love like there is no tomorrow.
-- Multiple popular references

The perfect is the enemy of the good.
-- Voltaire (loosely translated from the French)

A PhD doesn't mean you are an expert in any particular subject; it just means that you could become one if you wanted to.
-- Me (AFAIK)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.
-- Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut (attributed)
