Introduction
I am an associate professor at Boston University, with appointments in the:


Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Department of Computer Science
Division of Systems Engineering
Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences

Previously, I spent four years (2019-2023) also at Amazon as an Amazon Scholar in Alexa AI. From 2015-2018 I was the Peter J. Levine Career Development Assistant Professor in ECE and CS at Boston University, and from 2012-2015 I was an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Statistics at Ohio State University.

Before that, I spent three years as a postdoc at UC Berkeley EECS (Computer Science Division), and was also affiliated with ICSI, where I had the good fortune to work with Trevor Darrell, Stuart Russell, Michael Jordan, and Peter Bartlett. Broadly speaking, I am interested in all aspects of machine learning. A major focus is on large-scale optimization for core problems in machine learning such as metric learning, content-based search, clustering, and online learning. I also focus on applications with audio and visual data. I am also interested in large-scale graphical models, Bayesian inference, Bayesian nonparametrics, and deep learning.

I finished my Ph.D. in computer science in November, 2008, supervised by Inderjit Dhillon in the University of Texas at Austin computer science department. I did my undergrad in computer science and mathematics at Cornell University. I have also worked with John Platt and Arun Surendran at Microsoft Research on large-scale optimization, and as an undergraduate, I worked with John Hopcroft on tracking topics in networked data over time. During the Fall 2007 semester, I was a research fellow at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at U.C.L.A.
