Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences
University of Massachusetts Amherst


I work in the areas of security, privacy, and forensics applied to networking. Most recently my work has been focused child rescue (thwarting child sexual exploitation), an important non-partisan issue.

My work on thwarting child exploitation is often in collaboration with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force; through ICAC my group's work has had an international impact, including the rescue by law enforcement of many hundreds of children from sexual abuse based on our tools. In the networking area, my work includes mobile networking, disruption tolerant networks, cryptocurrency, and peer-to-peer networking. I am currently funded by the Department of Justice and the NSF.

You can see a list of all of my publications online. More information can be found on the UMass Amherst Rescue Lab website.

I am the founding Director of the UMass Amherst Cybersecurity Institute. And I am Co-Director of the Data Core, a UMass Core Facility that transitions research into practice.

	



		

In 2019, I gave an invited talk at USENIX Security on internet-based sexual exploitation of children, including how Tor Onion Services recklessly put journalists, dissidents, and abuse victims in harm's way. This talk is a good introduction to many of my efforts. It also expresses my concerns about the academic security community, which exist with heads in the sand. Or see the article Brian Lynn and I wrote in Lawfare.

Since almost no paper in ACM CCS, IEEE S&P, ISOC NDSS, and USENIX Security admits that Tor and Freenet are used for child sexual exploitation, I also maintain the CSAM Bibliography website, which lists academic papers and government reports that discuss child sexual explotiation on Tor and Freenet, as well as criminal cases.
