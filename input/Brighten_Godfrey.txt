I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science and the CSL at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am also a technical director at VMware, which I joined in 2019 with the acquisition of our startup Veriflow, where I was co-founder and CTO. Before joining UIUC, I was a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by Ion Stoica, and a visiting researcher at Intel Labs Berkeley.

Ph.D. applicants: I encourage you to apply to UIUC CS for the 2024 admission season. Our group is always interested in strong applicants in the broad area of networked systems, with work spanning system building, applications of machine learning to networked systems, and algorithms and optimization for networks. Read more about our group's current research thrusts below. To join, apply to our PhD program and list my name as one of the faculty you are interested to work with.

Undergraduate research: Drop me an email with your resume and a transcript.

Research

I enjoy building networked systems that address practical problems, with strong architectural and theoretical foundations. You can check out my complete list of papers. My group is currently working in several main areas:

Low latency networking including for XR/VR, web, and mobile apps: Speed of Light Internet, DChannel, HVCs
Service layer networking to optimize, observe, and secure communication between microservices: Service meshes as a new network layer, Distributed tracing without app instrumentation, expressive policies
Network verification and diagnosis including network fault localization (Flock), diagnosing performance problems in distributed apps (Murphy), verifying self-driving infrastructure, configuration verification (Plankton), and data plane verification (Anteater and VeriFlow, which led to our startup Veriflow, now part of VMware)
Machine learning for networked systems including online learning for congestion control (Aurora and PCC), deep learning as an adversary, and performance diagnosis (Murphy)

Other areas of work recently and in the past include:

Data center network topology
Compact routing and fast shortest path algorithms in social networks
Flexible Internet architectures
Peer-to-peer systems

Honored to be recognized with a 2022 Engineering Council Outstanding Advisor Award from the UIUC College of Engineering, which is due to an awesome group of students!
I've been happy to give a few virtual talks recently: at Cambridge University on "Software as a Network", at the UT Austin Sys/ML Workshop on "Towards Self-Driving Clouds Via Machine Learning", and at Cambridge and FutureWei on cISP (video online!).

2021:

Talk video now online: Adventures in Learning-Based Rate Control at the c3.ai workshop on Networks+ML in September
I'll be co-chairing ACM SIGCOMM 2022 with Bruce Maggs.
Check out our HotNets paper and Sachin's 10-minute talk video on Leveraging Service Meshes as a New Network Layer.
A few talks this fall -- at ONUG 2021 on spineless data center networks, at NetVerify 2021, and the c3.ai workshop on Networks of Machine Learning, for Machine Learning, by Machine Learning
We're excited that cISP, our project on designing an Internet that achieves nearly speed-of-light latency, will appear at NSDI 2022. Watch for the upcoming paper!
Congratulations to Ph.D. graduates Tong Meng and Ali Kheradmand!
