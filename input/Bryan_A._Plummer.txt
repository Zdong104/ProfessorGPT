My research interests fall within the umbrella of artificial intelligence with a focus on visual recognition, scene recognition, interpretable and fair machine learning, and understanding the relationship between vision and language.


As of July 2020 I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Boston University and a core faculty member of the Artificial Intelligence Research (AIR) initiative at the Rafik B. Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science & Engineering. I obtained my PhD in the computer vision group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign advised by Svetlana Lazebnik. After that I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate with Kate Saenko and Stan Sclaroff and later as a Research Assistant Professor before my current position. During my PhD I was fortunate to be named a 3M Foundation Fellow, NSF GRFP honorable mention, and was able to spend my summers working with Hadi Kiapour (eBay), Shuai Zheng (eBay), Robinson Piramuthu (eBay), Matthew Brown (Google), Himanshu Arora (A9), and Stephen Kelley (MIT Lincoln Labs).
