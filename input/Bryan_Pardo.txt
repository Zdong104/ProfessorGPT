CV



I head the Interactive Audio Lab. We invent technologies that transform how people find, separate, hear, understand, and manipulate sounds, with a focus on music as a problem domain. To learn more, visit our lab website.

I co-direct the Northwestern University Center for Human Computer Interaction + Design.

I am the faculty advisor for Latin@CS and chair the CS Diversity Committee.

When I'm not being an academic, I make music with the Latin Folk Fusion ensemble Son Monarcas and the Jazz/Maqam ensemble The East Loop.
