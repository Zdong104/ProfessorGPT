I am an Assistant Professor in UMass Amherst's Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences, where I am a member of the Theory Group.

I study algorithms, working at the intersection of theoretical computer science, numerical linear algebra, and machine learning. My group's research is supported in part by an NSF CAREER Award and a Google Research Scholar Award.

I completed my Ph.D. in the Theory of Computation Group at MIT, advised by Nancy Lynch. Before MIT, I studied Computer Science and Applied Math at Yale.

Here are my Google Scholar profile, CV, and GitHub.

Other Writing

Here are a few writeups, notes, and talks.

Projection-cost-preserving sketch note, containing simplified proofs for common projection-cost-preserving sketching techniques, following the work in our STOC 2015 and SODA 2017 papers.

VC dimension in (neural) circuit complexity, outline of a talk on the basics of VC dimension and how it can be used to give circuit size lower bounds for certain functions.

Fast Low-Rank Approximation and PCA Beyond Sketching, slides for a talk I gave at Mining Massive Datasets (MMDS 2016) on new techniques for large scale low-rank approximation. Corresponding video.

Chebyshev Polynomials in TCS and Algorithm Design, outline of a talk I gave at the MIT Theory student retreat on the many applications of Chebyshev polynomials to upper and lower bounds in Theoretical Computer Science.

Applications of Linear Sketching to Distributed Computing, slides for a talk I gave at our Theory of Distributed Systems seminar. High level overview of linear sketching, my work on k-means clustering and spectral sparsification, and applications to distributed data analysis.

Linear Regression and Pseudoinverse Cheatsheet, since there are a lot of ways to explain the pseudoinverse.

Big-O and Asymptotic Notation Cheatsheet, just in case.

Other Projects

I've worked on a lot of projects, some more serious than others.

I built this Rap Collaboration Graph, which gives a visualization of musical collaborations in hip hop. Unfortunately, colors are only rendering in Safari right now, it looks fuzzy on retina displays, and the data is about a year (10 years...) out of date. But I promise I'll get to it.

I had a lot of fun helping build the first version of One Button Wenzel, a site that sold buffalo chicken sandwiches. It evolved into Crunchbutton, then devolved back into One Button Wenzel. Here is a screenshot of the original site in all its glory.

In college I also had a lot of fun working on Yale's Formula Hydrid Racecar Team.

I love to ski, and a long time ago, my brother Chris and I used to build custom skis. Our first pair had maple/poplar cores, varnished wood sidewalls, and flex comparable to a pair of 2x4s. Our second pair has more precisely shaped pine cores, an improved top sheet, and a much smoother flex. The tips delaminated once, but we riveted them together and still ski on them today! Here's an old forum post on SkiBuilders.com with more pictures of our setup.
