Camille Cobb

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois.

Until July 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher working with Lujo Bauer in the CyLab at Carnegie Mellon University.

I earned my Phd in June 2019 from the University of Washington in Computer Science & Engineering. During my PhD, I was advised by Tadayoshi Kohno in the Security & Privacy Research Lab and Alexis Hiniker from the UW Information School.

Research Interests

My research focus in usable security and privacy. My work aims to ellucidate and address users' security and privacy concerns. In particular, I recognize that many perspectives have been historically left out of conversations about security and privacy, and I seek to correct for this through my work.

For more details, see my CV.

Other Interests

Some of my non-research interests include: hanging out with my awesome dog; dancing (recently, on roller skates); playing soccer and softball; going to local sports games; knitting and other artistic endeavors.

Students

I am currently advising the following talented PhD students:

Yi-Shyuan Chiang (UIUC CS PhD started Fall 2021)
Yeeun Jo (UIUC CS PhD started Fall 2022, co-advised by Adam Bates Yuile)

I am also fortunate to work or have worked closely with these students:

Ali Zaidi (UIUC CS PhD, advised by Karrie Karahalios and Indy Gupta)
Mahnoor Jameel (UIUC CS PhD, advised by Adam Bates Yuile)

Aiko Lin
Ankitha Bharadwaj
Brian Do
Eng Phannipha
Janelle Van Hofwegen
Jared Comis
Joe Kohlmann
