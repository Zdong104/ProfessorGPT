Brief Bio

I am a professor in the computer science department at Columbia, and my research studies computer vision, machine learning, and their applications.

I was previously a research scientist on the machine perception team at Google, and a visiting researcher at Cruise. I completed my PhD at MIT in 2017 advised by Antonio Torralba and my BS at UC Irvine in 2011, where I got my start working with Deva Ramanan.

I received the 2024 PAMI Young Researcher Award and the 2021 NSF CAREER Award. I am also the Senior Program Chair for ICLR 2025.

Research

By training machines to observe and interact with their surroundings, our research aims to create robust and versatile models for perception. Our lab often investigates visual models that capitalize on large amounts of unlabeled data and transfer across tasks and modalities. Other interests include scene dynamics, sound and language and beyond, interpretable models, and perception for robotics.

Our lab recruits one or two PhD students each fall. Prospective PhD students should apply to the PhD program.

Representative Papers

Our research creates perception systems with diverse skills, including spatial, physical, logical, and reasoning abilities, for flexibly analyzing visual data. Our multimodal approach provides versatile representations for tasks like 3D reconstruction, visual question answering, and robot manipulation, while offering inherent explainability and excellent zero-shot generalization. The below papers highlight key examples of these capabilities.
