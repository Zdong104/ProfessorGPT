BIOGRAPHY

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Emory University since 2020. Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, where I was working in the Data Mining Group, advised by Prof. Jiawei Han. Further before, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science in 2014, from the Chu Kochen Honors College of Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Xiaofei He.

My research interests lie in graph data mining, applied machine learning, knowledge graphs and federated learning, as well as their applications in recommender systems, social networks, neurocience and healthcare.

I am open to discuss research opportunities with motivated students who have strong backgrounds in machine learning and/or health informatics. Please reach out only if you are ready to devote time and effort in a research project.
