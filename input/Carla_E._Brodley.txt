Biography

Carla E. Brodley is the Dean of Inclusive Computing and the Founding Executive Director of the Center for Inclusive Computing (CIC) at Northeastern University. A $50M initiative, the CIC funds and advises universities in the United States to create systemic, sustainable change to remove institutional barriers that impact the discovery, retention and persistence in computing. In this role, she works with presidents, provosts, deans, chairs and faculty at over 80 universities, raising money from government, corporations and philanthropists.

Previously, she served as Dean of Khoury College of Computer Sciences (2014-2021) and as the sole dean appointed to the Northeastern University Presidential Cabinet, serving as a senior advisor to President Aoun (2019-2021). Prior to joining Northeastern, she was a professor of the Department of Computer Science (2004-2014) and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at Tufts Medical Center (2011-2014), and Chair of the Department of Computer Science (2010-2013) at Tufts University. Before joining Tufts she was on the faculty of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University (1994-2004).

A fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Dean Brodley’s interdisciplinary machine learning research led to advances not only in computer science, but in many other areas including remote sensing, neuroscience, digital libraries, astrophysics, content- based image retrieval of medical images, computational biology, chemistry, evidence-based medicine, and predictive medicine.

Dean Brodley’s leadership positions include serving as program co-chair of International Conference on Machine Learning, co-chair of AAAI, and serving as associate editor of Machine Learning, the Journal of AI Research, and the Journal of Machine Learning Research. She served on the Defense Science Study Group, the board of the International Machine Learning Society, the AAAI Council, the executive committee of the Northeast Big Data Hub, DARPA’s Information Science and Technology Board, as a member-at-large of the Section on Information, Computing, and Communication of AAAS, and as a member of the advisory committee for the NSF’s CISE Directorate. Currently she serves on the boards/advisory councils of the Computing Research Association, Mass Technology Leadership Council, and the Jackson Laboratory (Vice Chair).
