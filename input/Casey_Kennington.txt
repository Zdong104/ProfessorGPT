Casey Kennington, PhD

I am an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at Boise State University. I principally do research in interactive spoken dialogue systems, semantics, human-robot interaction, and language acquisition. 

I lead the Speech, Language and Interactive Machines Group at Boise State University. The video above shows some of the things we do in the SLIM Research Group.
