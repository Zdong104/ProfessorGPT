I am an Associate Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft Research New York. I received my PhD from the Computer Science Department at University of California, Santa Barbara in December 2012. I received my Bachelors degree from Computer Science Dept. @Bilkent University in Turkey in 2007.




My research interests lie in the area of computational social science; a discipline at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and the social sciences. I am particularly interested in applying large scale data analysis techniques to study problems with social, political, and policy implications.





Active Projects

Below are a few active research projects I am interested in. Each is accompanied with a word cloud from one of my related papers. Because who doesn't like pretty figures?



News Media Production & Consumption

News media are a key source of information for society. How is this source of information produced and how is it consumed? Are news outlets biased? Do readers prefer ideologically biased content?

Our efforts that resulted in advances in modeling diffusion, limiting the spread of misinformation and trend detection in social networks.

Measuring and Promoting the Quality of Online Discussions

This project will amplify the efforts of people to bring out the best in other people in online conversations, and will make it easier for people to find high quality online conversations. The first goal of the research is to create automated classifiers to measure the quality of everyday online political talk. The second goal of the research is to create a Conversation Coach that helps the general public to improve the quality of conversation spaces they participate in, by helping them craft messages that directly contribute to quality and that indirectly inspire others.
