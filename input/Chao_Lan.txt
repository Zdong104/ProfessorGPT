Description: 	
Lan, Chao
Assistant Professor
School of Computer Science
University of Oklahoma
email: clan [AT] ou.edu


I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science, Gallogly College of Engineering, at the University of Oklahoma (OU). I am also affiliated with the Data Science and Analytics Institute at OU.
I work on machine learning. My research explores those provable probabilistic natures of a learning task and exploits them to better understand or improve task efficiency and trustworthiness such as model fairness, data privacy and learner security. My current research focuses on randomized learning.
I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Kansas. Here is my CV.
