Research

I develop data science and machine learning models to assist with task solving and decision-making. My research focuses on rapidly developing AI systems that are more data-efficient, trustworthy, and customized for specific domains.

Currently, I am working on the following themes:

Data-Efficient AI – Adapting Large Language Models for target domains by addressing data scarcity challenges through data-efficient methods such as feedback-based adaptation, weak supervision, and active learning.
Trustworthy AI – Making AI models more reliable and aligned with human values through uncertainty quantification, robust fine-tuning, scalable alignment, and decision-focused learning.
AI for Science – Leveraging data science and AI to accelerate scientific discovery in fields like material science, biomedical and life sciences, and urban science through close collaboration with domain experts.

I. Data-Efficient AI

We aim to adapt LLMs to various domains and complex tasks. A key bottleneck when adapting LLMs is data scarcity – the lack of high-quality, representative data for the target domain. We are tackling this bottleneck by developing methods for data-efficient LLM adaptation, including:

Enhancing LLM Reasoning Through Feedback: We investigate improving LLM reasoning and planning abilities by enabling them to evolve through interaction with external environments for feedback. The goal is to better adapt LLMs and enhance their reasoning capabilities without expensive manual curation of fine-tuning data.

ToolQA: A Dataset for LLM Question Answering with External Tools, NeurIPS'23
Fine-Tuning LLMs with Weak Supervision: To address the lack of data for LLM fine-tuning, we explore using weaker forms of supervision signals that are easier to collect (e.g., labeling rules, distant supervision, pseudo labels). We investigate 1) fine-tuning LLMs with weak supervision; and 2) discovering rules from language models for interactive weak supervision.

II. Trustworthy AI

We aim to develop AI systems that are not only capable but also trustworthy for deployment in various domains. We focus on several aspects of trustworthy AI: uncertainty quantification for deep learning, robust LLM fine-tuning and alignment, and decision-focused learning.

Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning: Uncertainty-aware ML models are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems. Many deep learning models produce uncertainty-agnostic point estimates or miscalibrated distributions. We are addressing this issue by designing techniques for quantifying uncertainty in deep learning models:

SDE-Net: Equipping Deep Neural Networks with Uncertainty Estimates, ICML'20
RDeepSense: Reliable Deep Mobile Computing Models with Uncertainty Estimations, UbiComp'18
Robust LLM Fine-Tuning and Alignment: We investigate robust fine-tuning methods for LLMs to improve generalization on out-of-distribution data, as well as identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs and scalably aligning them:
Aligning Large Language Models with Representation Editing: A Control Perspective, preprint
Large Language Model as Attributed Training Data Generator: A Tale of Diversity and Bias, NeurIPS'23
COCO-DR: Combating the Distribution Shift in Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval with Contrastive and Distributional Robust Learning, EMNLP'22
Calibrated Language Model Fine-Tuning for In- and Out-of-Distribution Data, EMNLP'20
Decision-Focused Learning: We study how to make learning informed by downstream decision-making tasks. We design end-to-end decision-focused learning methods that are scalable and can handle hard-to-specify constraints:
Diffusion Models as Constrained Samplers for Optimization with Unknown Constraints, preprint
DF2: Distribution-Free Decision-Focused Learning, preprint
End-to-end Stochastic Programming with Energy-based Model, NeurIPS'22
III. AI for Science

We aim to leverage data science and AI for scientific applications ranging from macro-level systems like transportation and epidemiology to micro-level systems such as molecules. We have been developing data-driven tools to advance scientific discovery in material design, biomedical and life science, and urban science:
