Charith Mendis

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to that, I was a visiting faculty researcher at Google Brain. My broad interests are at the intersection of compilers, program optimization and machine learning. I lead the ADAPT lab. Our current work is focused on two main fronts.

Automated compiler construction using machine learning and formal reasoning techniques targeting both commodity hardware and domain specific accelerators as well as diverse workloads.
High-performance compilation and program optimization techniques for machine learning and data science workloads.
