I am a professor and head of the Department of Computer Science here at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. I earned my PhD at the University of Wisconsin in the Computer Sciences Department. I earned my bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Williams College.

I teach both undergraduate and graduate courses in the department. This fall (2019) I'm teaching Computational Vision, CSCI 4270 and 6270. All information about the course is available through Submitty. See submitty.org for more information about the Submitty project.

My research is in computer vision, with applications in ecology and environmental conservation. The most exciting part of my work is the Wildbook project (earlier referred to as "IBEIS" (Image-Based Ecological Information System), where I lead much of the research in computer vision and machine learning. You can learn about older work by the computer vision group in the Department of Computer Science through our home page.

I am also Founder and Chief Scientist of DualAlign, LLC. Check our line of photomosaicking, image montaging, and single-modal and mulit-modal image registration software.
