I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University and co-founder of Pi. My lab, IRIS, studies intelligence through robotic interaction at scale, and is affiliated with SAIL and the ML Group.

I am interested in the capability of robots and other agents to develop broadly intelligent behavior through learning and interaction.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at UC Berkeley and my B.S. in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. I also spent time at Google as part of the Google Brain team.
