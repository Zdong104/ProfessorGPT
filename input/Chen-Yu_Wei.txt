I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at the University of Virginia. Before, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT working with Prof. Sasha Rakhlin, and a Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Haipeng Luo. Please find my CV here.

Research

I am broadly interested in the field of interactive machine learning. My work is centered around the following topics:

Robust and adaptive learning algorithms for non-stationary or adversarial environments;
Sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms with strategic exploration;
Decentralized multi-agent learning algorithms with efficient communication and coordination.

I am actively seeking collaborative opportunities, particularly those with a strong potential for practical application.
