About Me

I am an assistant professor of computer science at Brown University, where I direct the PALMðŸŒ´ research lab, studying computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I work part-time as a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind.

Our research focuses on multimodal concept learning and reasoning, temporal dynamics modeling of humans and objects, and transfer learning of representation and skills to embodied agents. I believe multimodal learning is a pathway for computer vision to help language understanding, robotics, and social science.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Southern California in 2016, advised by Prof. Ram Nevatia. I completed my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Tsinghua University in 2011.

I have received Brown University's Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award and Samsung AIT's Global Research Outreach Award for multimodal concept learning from videos. My research on behavior prediction appeared in the CVPR 2019 best paper finalist. I am serving as area chairs for CVPR, NeurIPS, and ACL conferences. I am also a junior faculty teaching fellow at Brown.
