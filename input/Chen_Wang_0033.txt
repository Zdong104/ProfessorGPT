About Us

We are proud to be part of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), University at Buffalo (UB).

Our research goal is to achieve human-level spatial awareness and reasoning on robotic systems. We are interested in all aspects of algorithm development, including creating efficient algorithms, proving their theoretical properties, distributing them to open-source communities, and validating them on real-world robots.
