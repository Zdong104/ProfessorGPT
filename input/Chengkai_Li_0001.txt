Dr. Chengkai Li is Professor, Associate Chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and Director of the Innovative Data Intelligence Research Laboratory (IDIR) at the University of Texas at Arlington. Dr. Li's research interests span several areas related to big data intelligence and data science, including data management, data mining, natural language processing, applied machine learning, and their applications in computational journalism. His current research focuses on building large-scale human-assisting and human-assisted data and information systems with high usability, high efficiency and applications for social good. Particularly, his ongoing research projects include data-driven fact-checking and web credibility, exceptional fact finding, usability challenges in querying and exploring graph data, and knowledge graphs. He has also worked on data exploration by ranking (top-k), skyline and preference queries, crowdsourcing, entity queries, database testing, database engine for top-k queries, and Web and XML data management.
