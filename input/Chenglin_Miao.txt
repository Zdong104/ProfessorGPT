Biography



I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. Prior to joining Iowa State, I was an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Georgia from 2020 to 2022. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where I was supervised by Prof. Lu Su. My research interests include Internet of things, cyber-physical systems, security & privacy, and machine learning. I am especially interested in developing novel techniques for the security, privacy, and safety of emerging IoT systems and machine learning algorithms.
