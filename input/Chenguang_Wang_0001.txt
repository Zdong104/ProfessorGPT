I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, and the Founder and Director of the WashU Natural Language Processing Group. I am also a member of the Division of Computational and Data Sciences and the AI for Health Institute.

Previously, I was a postdoc in computer science at UC Berkeley. I was also a research scientist at Amazon AI and a research staff member at IBM Research-Almaden. I completed my Ph.D. at Peking University, and was a visiting Ph.D. student at UIUC.

Research Interests: Natural language processing, machine learning, and security.

Prospective Students and Postdocs: Please see this page.
