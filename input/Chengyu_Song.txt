About Me

I am an Associate Professor in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Riverside. I earned by Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. I was fortunate to be supervised by professor Wenke Lee and Taesoo Kim.

My research interests include system security, deep learning, program analysis and verification, and operating systems. My current research focuses on vulnerability related topics, including

Advancing techniques for finding vulnerabilities in binaries, OS kernels, machine learning, and cyber-physical systems.
Eliminating vulnerabilities through automatic patch generation and verification.
New exploit techniques and automated exploit generation.
Runtime exploit prevention with software hardware co-design.
