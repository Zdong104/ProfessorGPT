About Me

I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Rochester and an affiliated faculty member of the Goergen Institute for Data Science. My research originates in computer vision and tackles interdisciplinary topics, including video understanding, audio-visual learning, vision and language, and methods for trustworthy AI. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2016.
