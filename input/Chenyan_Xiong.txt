I am an Associate Professor at Language Technologies Institute (LTI), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). My research area is the intersection of information retrieval, natural language processing, and deep learning. Previously I worked at Microsoft Research till 2023 Fall, after completing my Ph.D. at LTI, CMU, in 2018. Before coming to the US, I completed my undergraduate study at Wuhan University, China, in 2009 and got a master’s degree at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Science, in 2012.

My work mainly appears in IR, NLP, and Machine Learning conferences. I also host workshops, present tutorials, and serve in the organization community of venues in these fields. For the most updated publication list, please refer to my Google Scholar.
