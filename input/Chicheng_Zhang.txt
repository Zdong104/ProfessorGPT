About Me

Hello! I am an assistant professor at the Computer Science Department, the University of Arizona. From September 2017 to June 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the machine learning group of Microsoft Research NYC. I got my PhD in Computer Science at UCSD, where I was lucky to have Prof. Kamalika Chaudhuri as my advisor. Before this, I was an undergraduate student at Peking University, studying learning theory with Prof. Liwei Wang.

Research

My research interests lie in theory and applications of machine learning. I primarily work on interactive machine learning, including but not restricted to:

active learning,
contextual bandits,
reinforcement learning,
imitation learning,
where learning agents take an active role in data collection processes and perform inference, prediction, and decision making. Specifically, I am interested in:
designing and analyzing interactive learning algorithms that have data-efficiency, computational efficiency, and robustness guarantees, as well as,
identifying new and natural interaction mechanisms learning agents can benefit from.

I also have interests in unsupervised learning, as well as quantifying and utilizing confidence and uncertainty in machine learning.
