Description: 	Chien-Ju Ho
About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at Cornell University working with Arpita Ghosh. In October 2015, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UCLA, where I am fortunate to be advised by Jenn Wortman Vaughan. I also spent three wonderful years from 2012 to 2015 visiting the EconCS Group at Harvard University, where I was hosted by Yiling Chen.

My research broadly connects to the fields of machine learning, optimization, behavioral sciences, and algorithmic economics. I am interested in investigating the interactions between humans and AI, including enabling AI algorithms to learn from humans (e.g., in the context of crowdsourcing) and designing AI algorithms to assist human decision-making (e.g., through information design and environment design).

For more information, please see my CV and Google Scholar page. You can also reach me via [chienju.ho at wustl dot edu].

News
Lauren's work on investigating the consequences of AI training on human decision making is accepted at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)!


Received a research award from OpenAI (on leveraging weak human supervision to improve strong ML models) and a seed grant from TRIADS (on investigating human trust in ML models in the domain of housing). Thanks for the support!


Wei Tang will be joining Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) School of Business as an assistant professor in Fall 2024. Congrats Wei!
