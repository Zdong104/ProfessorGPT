Cho-Jui Hsieh

I am an associate professor of Computer Science at UCLA. I was a Ph.D. student at UT Austin working with Prof. Inderjit Dhillon. I received my master degree in National Taiwan University under supervision of Prof. Chih-Jen Lin. Before joining UCLA, I have worked as an Assistant Professor at UC Davis Computer Science and Statistics for three years, and was a visiting scholar in Google since summer 2018.

I am interested in developing new algorithms and optimization techniques for large-scale machine learning problems. Currently, I am working on developing new machine learning models as well as improving the model size, training speed, prediction speed, and robustness of popular (deep learning) models.
