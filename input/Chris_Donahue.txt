I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, and also a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind on the Magenta team (part-time).

My research goal is to develop and responsibly deploy generative AI for music and creativity, thereby unlocking and augmenting human creative potential. To this end, my work involves (1) improving machine learning methods for controllable generative modeling for music, audio, and other sequential data, and (2) deploying real-world interactive systems that allow a broader audience—inclusive of non-musicians—to harness generative music AI through intuitive controls.

I am particularly drawn to research ideas with direct real-world applications, and my work often involves building systems for real users to be evaluated in-the-wild. For example, my work on Piano Genie was used in a live performance by The Flaming Lips, and my work on Dance Dance Convolution powers Beat Sage, a live service used by thousands of users a day to create multimodal music game content.

Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford CS advised by Percy Liang. Before that, I completed a PhD at UCSD co-advised by Miller Puckette and Julian McAuley.

G-CLef

I lead the Generative Creativity Lab (G-CLef) at CMU. Our research focuses on the development and deployment of generative AI towards augmenting human creativity. We primarily focus on musical creativity as an application domain but also explore other areas such as gaming.
