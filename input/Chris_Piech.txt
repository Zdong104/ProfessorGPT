 The Piech Lab

I was born and grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. When I was twelve I moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where I lived until I came to Stanford for university, liked it a lot and stayed. I love teaching and I'm into exploring our world (through both science and travelling). My research is in machine learning to understand human learning.

News (March, 2024):
Code in Place: As a service project teaches CS106A to 30k students with 3k volunteer TAs via Code in Place. It is good time!
Best paper awards: The lab is humbled to have received recent best paper awards from SIGCSE'24, EDM'22, EDM'20, L@S'20 and AAAI'19
