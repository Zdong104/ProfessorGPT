CHRISTIAN POELLABAUER
PROFESSOR · FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY
INTERIM ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR RESEARCH AND GRADUATE STUDIES
CPOELLAB@FIU.EDU · 305-348-1545


- Ph.D., Georgia Institute of Technology, May 2004
- Diplom-Ingenieur, University of Technology Vienna, June 1998

My research interests intersect the systems and data science domains, focusing on effective and efficient ways to collect and analyze sensor data at scale. At FIU, I lead the MOSAIC (MObile Sensing and AnalytICs) Lab, where we build, deploy, and investigate sensing and analysis challenges in areas such as healthcare, the Internet-of-Things, smart cities, wireless communications, and transportation. Some specific research questions being investigated in our lab include: how to efficiently and effectively utilize the rich sensing capabilities of commercial mobile and wearable devices, how to fuse different sensing modalities and perform multi-sensor time-series data analysis for a variety of applications, how to build context-aware sensing systems, how to perform sensor analysis on resource-constrained devices in real time, and how to translate the insights obtained from the sensor data into new applications or interventions.

I am currently a professor in the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences at Florida International University. Prior to joining FIU, I was a professor at the University of Notre Dame, where I led the Mobile Computing Lab (M-Lab) and served as Associate Director of the Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society and Founding Director of the Applied Analytics and Emerging Technologies Lab (AeTL). I have strong interest in economic, startup, and other commercialization efforts and I am also a strong advocate of early inclusion of undergraduate and high school students in research projects, many of whom have decided to pursue graduate school or form/join startup businesses.
