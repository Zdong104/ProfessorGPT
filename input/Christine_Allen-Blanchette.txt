Short Bio

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Center for Statistics and Machine Learning at Princeton University, and hold an affiliation with Robotics at Princeton. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, geometry and dynamical systems.

Prior to my current appointment, I was part of the inaugural class of Princeton Presidential Postdoctoral Fellows and mentored by Naomi Leonard. I completed my PhD in Computer Science and Master’s in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania where I was supervised by Kostas Daniilidis. Prior to my graduate work, I completed Bachelor’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering at San Jose State University.
