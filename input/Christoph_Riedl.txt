Collaborative Social Systems Lab
at Northeastern University
Digital business transformation and the rise of powerful generative AI will have a tremendous impact on the workforce of the future. Future work environments will be characterized by a growing emphasis on remote work and AI. The Collaborative Social Systems Lab, directed by Christoph Riedl, explores how the Future of Work will look like and how we can organize teams, crowds, and human-AI teams to be collectively intelligent.
