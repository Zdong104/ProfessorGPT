Assistant Professor
Faculty Member, Institute for Security, Technology and Society
Binary program analysis/reverse engineering/vulnerability discovery

I specialize in software security and build models to reason about new cyber attacks and defenses across the software stack and hardware boundaries. My work is at the intersection of program analysis, formal methods and machine learning with applications to reverse engineering and vulnerability discovery and a focus on binary code and firmware. My research interests also include intrusion detection, usable security and privacy-preserving systems.
