Gates Hall, Room 426

I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science department at Cornell University. I am a member of the Cornell Machine Learning Group and I lead the Relax ML Lab. My research interests include algorithmic, software, and hardware techniques for high-performance machine learning, with a focus on relaxed-consistency variants of stochastic algorithms such as asynchronous and low-precision stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Markov chain Monte Carlo. My work builds towards using these techniques to construct data analytics and machine learning frameworks, including for deep learning, that are efficient, parallel, and distributed.

I graduated from Stanford University in 2017, where I was advised by Kunle Olukotun and by Chris R‌é.
