Description: Christopher Musco

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. My students and I are part of NYU's Theoretical Computer Science Group and the VIDA Center. Our research is on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for understanding data, and combines ideas from theoretical computer science with tools from computational mathematics. We are funded by the Dept. of Energy and National Science Foundation, including by an NSF CAREER Award.

I was previously a Research Instructor at Princeton and completed my PhD at MIT, where I was fortunate to be advised by Jon Kelner. Before MIT I was an engineer at Redfin and I studied Applied Math and Computer Science at Yale. Outside of research, I am involved in organizing the annual MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge for high school students.

News, Events, Travel

Congrats to Raphael Meyer, who successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis on query complexity in numerical linear algebra in May! Raphael was awarded Tandon's Pearl Brownstein Award for his thesis work and is off to Caltech for a postdoc with Joel Tropp's group next year. Raphael has been a pleasure to work with and speak for the whole group when I say that will miss him dearly.

We are holding NYU's in-person CS Theory Seminar on Thursdays. You can also sign up for the email list to receive announcements about upcoming talks.

If you are interested in working with me on research, I would encourage you to apply to NYU Tandon's PhD program in Computer Science. If you are an undergraduate or masters student at NYU, the best way to start a collaboration or to obtain a TA position is to first complete my fall algorithms class, CS-GY 6763.
