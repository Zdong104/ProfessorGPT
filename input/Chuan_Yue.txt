About

Chuan Yue is a Professor of Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines (Mines). His current research focuses on Cybersecurity, especially on (1) Web, Mobile, Cloud, CPS/IoT, and AI systems security, (2) usable security and privacy, (3) vulnerability measurement and analysis, and (4) cybersecurity education. His broad research interests include Security and Privacy, Web-based Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, Collaborative Computing, Distributed and Parallel Computing, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Computing. His research and educational activities have been supported by NSF, DOD, and Meta (big thanks!). He is the founder and current point of contact (POC) of the Center for Cyber Security and Privacy (CCSP) at Mines. He is a Daniels Fund Faculty Fellow from 2016 to 2019 (on incorporating ethics instruction into security and privacy courses). He received his B.E. and M.E. degrees in Computer Science from the Xidian University, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the College of William and Mary in 2010. He worked as a Member of Technical Staff at Bell Labs China, Lucent Technologies for four years from 1999 to 2003, mainly on the design and development of the Web-based Distributed Service Management System for Intelligent Network. He worked as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) for five years (and commuted between Denver and Colorado Springs for four years) before joining Mines.
