I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Texas State University, San Marcos, TX. Prior to that, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Engineering and Sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, and a senior research engineer at Samsung Electronics DMC R&D Center (now Samsung Research), South Korea. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC.

My research interests are in network science, data science, networking, and networked/computing systems. My recent focus is on 

Efficient algorithms and computational tools for graph mining and network analysis, 

Modeling, analysis, and control of epidemic/information spreading, and 

Machine learning for mobile and IoT applications. 

I am also interested in big data analytics acceleration, and modeling, analysis, and optimization of large-scale networked systems. 

Our research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, NVIDIA, SK Hynix America, Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning, etc.
