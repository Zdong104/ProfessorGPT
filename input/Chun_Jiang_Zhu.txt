Research Interests: Machine Learning and Theory, Graph Algorithms, Chemoinformatics, and Cyber-Physical Systems.

Self-motivated Ph.D. students are wanted every year. Early research collaboration before the position is encouraged. If interested, drop me an email with your resume, (informal) transcript, and sample publication(s).

Recent News: Master student Srilekha Geda got a paper "Density-Preserving Heterogeneous Graph Sparsification for Representation Learning" accepted in the ICLR'24.

Thrilled to announce that I have recently received a research grant of $372,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish an REU Site at UNC Greensboro as a PI [Award]. The funds will provide 8-week paid summer research opportunity in the foundations of graph machine learning and network analysis and their concrete applications in real-life networks. Ads coming soon!
