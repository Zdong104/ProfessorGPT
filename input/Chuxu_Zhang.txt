About Me
I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brandeis University. My general research interests center around artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Recently, I have focused on developing effective, efficient, safe, and generative machine learning models and algorithms on graph data and multi-modality data (e.g., text and image). Besides, I apply machine learning to solve societal challenges in healthcare, social media, science, and others. Before joining Brandeis, I did my PhD study at University of Notre Dame (2017-2020), advised by Nitesh Chawla.
