I am passionate about designing and implementing timing-predictable, resource-efficient, and robust autonomous embedded and real-time systems, with robotics and autonomous vehicles being the currently focused application domains. Our recent projects conduct highly inter-disciplinary research intersecting systems, machine learning, and robotics.

I am interested in working with self-motivated students who strive for research excellence. In the past, students in our group have had excellent academic and industry job placements. If you are interested in my research and working with me, please include some samples of your work (e.g., major projects, open source contributions, etc.) when contacting me directly.

For current UCR students who are interested in working with me, please stop by my office so that we can discuss and see if there is a good match.
