Biography

I am an associate professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the University of California Riverside. Before this I was an assistant adjunct professor in the department of mathematics at the University of California Los Angeles, before which I was a postdoctoral scholar with Joseph Teran in the same department. I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 2011 with Ron Fedkiw. I received a B.S. in mathematics and computer science and a M.S. in computer science from Drexel University in 2006. I received the Chancellor's Award for Postdoctoral Research in 2013, recognizing research impact and value to the UCLA community. My research interests include computational fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid-structure interaction, physically-based simulation for computer graphics, mathematical modeling and scientific computing.

I am looking for new Ph.D. students for next year. If you are interested in scientific computing or computer graphics and would like to join my research group, please send me an email with your CV (including GPA).

If you are an undergraduate or graduate student at UCR and would like to get involved in research in my area, please send me an email.
