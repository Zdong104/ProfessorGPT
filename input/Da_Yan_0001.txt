Biography




I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Sciences of the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering (SICE) at Indiana University Bloomington. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2014, and I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Fudan University in Shanghai in 2009. I am a DOE Early Career Research Program (ECRP) awardee in 2023, and the sole winner of the Hong Kong 2015 Young Scientist Award in Physical/Mathematical Science. My research interests include parallel and distributed systems for big data analytics, data management, data mining and machine learning. See here for more information about my research

    I am currently looking for Ph.D. students interested in research on big data systems, data mining and machine learning. The students will be fully funded. Please feel free to contact me, and please include your CV and transcripts for all degrees.
