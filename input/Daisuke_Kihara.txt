Kihara Bioinformatics Laboratory

Our research interests lie in the area of bioinformatics. We employ computational methods to elucidate intertwined relationships between protein/gene sequences, structure, function, interactions, genome, and pathways. The ultimate goal of our research projects is to obtain new, comprehensive understanding of how structures and functions are coded in molecular sequences and how functions of molecules are orchestrated in a cell.
