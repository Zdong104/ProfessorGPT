Daisy Zhe Wang is an Associate Professor in the CISE department at the University of Florida. She is the Director of the Data Science Research Lab at UF. She obtained her Ph.D. degree from the EECS Department at the University of California, Berkeley in 2011 and her Bachelor’s degree from the ECE Department at the University of Toronto in 2005. At Berkeley, she was a member of the Database Group and the AMP/RAD Lab. She is particularly interested in bridging scalable data management and processing systems with probabilistic models and statistical methods. She currently pursues research topics such as probabilistic databases, probabilistic knowledge bases, large-scale inference engines, query-driven interactive machine learning, and crowd assisted machine learning. She received Google Faculty Award in 2014. Along with other co-authors, she received “10-Years Test-of-Time” Award for the 2018 VLDB paper on WebTables. She received Arno and Lisa Goldberg Rising Star Associate Professorship in 2019. She is inducted into the Senior Members of ACM in 2022. Her research is externally funded by NSF, NIH, DARPA, NIST, Google, Amazon, Pivotal, Greenplum/EMC, Adobe, DTCC, Sandia National Labs and Harris Corporation.

A Parable of Modern Research

Bob has lost his keys in a room which is dark except for one brightly lit corner.
“Why are you looking under the light, you lost them in the dark!”
“I can only see here.”
