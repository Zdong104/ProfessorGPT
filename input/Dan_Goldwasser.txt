Dan Goldwasser

I am an associate professor at the department of computer science at Purdue university. I am broadly interested in connecting natural language with real world scenarios, and using them to guide natural language understanding.
Before starting at Purdue I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland in College Park. I completed my Ph.D. studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the department of Computer Science.
