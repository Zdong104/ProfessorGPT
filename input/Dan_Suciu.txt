Brief

I am a Microsoft Endowed Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. I teach databases and do research in data management, where I apply formal theory to novel and difficult data management tasks. I worked on semistructured data, probabilistic databases, parallel query evaluation on a cluster, causal reasoning in databases, information theory for cardinality estimation, recursive querie. For a short bio please see here.

My Erdos number is 2.
