Description: Danfei Xu

I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and a (part-time) Research Scientist at NVIDIA AI. I work at the intersection of Robotics and Machine Learning.

I received my Ph.D. in CS from Stanford University advised by Fei-Fei Li and Silvio Savarese (2015-2021) and B.S. from Columbia University (SEAS'15). I've spent time at DeepMind UK (2019), ZOOX (2017), Autodesk Research (2016), CMU RI (2014), and Columbia Robotics Lab (2013-2015).

Research opportunities: Please fill out this questionnaire and email me once submitted.
We especially encourage applications from students of traditionally underrepresented groups in robotics and AI such as BIPOC (black, indigenous, and people of color), women, and LGBTQ+ communities.

Research

We aim to build general-purpose and adaptable "brains" for robots in home, factory, healthcare, and search & rescue missions alike. Our work focuses on endowing robots with both flexible high-level planning abilities ("what to do next") and robust low-level sensorimotor control ("how to do it"). The research draws equally from Robotics and Machine Learning, with the following themes:

Compositionality: Inspired by human's ability to "make infinite use of finite means", we aim to enable (good!) combinatorial explosions in robots' ability to solve new tasks. Examples include neural program synthesis for control [a][b], compositional diffusion models for planning [a], and learning neural-symbolic motor skills [a].
Generative Modeling: Modeling complex, high-dimensional distributions is fundamental to many robotics problems. We aim to advance core generative modeling research and their applications to robotics problems. Examples include modeling human behaviors in human-robot collaboration [a][b], modeling dynamics in manipulation planning [a], and explorative "play" behaviors [a][b].
Data-centric Robot Learning: While many AI domains have achieved remarkable success with large-scale learning, Robotics is critically limited in data scale and coverage. Our work develop systems and algorithms for data collection [a], generation [a], quality control [a], as well as standard datasets and benchmarks [a].
Full-stack Robot Learning: Robotics is as much science as system building. We are committed to developing high-quality, open-source robot hardware and software systems to demonstrate and promote "full-stack" progress in learning-based robotics. We actively maintain Robomimic, a general-purpose Robot Learning framework and benchmark.
