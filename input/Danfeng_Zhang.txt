Research Statement

Software plays a crucial rule in the digital age. Yet, it is still very challenging to develop correct and secure software, even for veteran software developers. The goal of my research is to prove the absence of software errors, and further, generate fixes when things go wrong. My research currently includes security, privacy, type safety and software correctness.

Selected Projects [Google scholar] [Complete List]
Differential privacy: Differential privacy provides a mathematical definition for the privacy loss to individuals when aggregated data is released. Unfortunately, the growing popularity of differential privacy is accompanied by an increase in the development of incorrect algorithms. We explore novel approaches to prove correct mechanisms, and/or generate counterexamples for incorrect mechanisms.

Side channel security: Side-channel attacks exploit information gathered from the physical implementation of computer systems to steal sensitive data. They are becoming an increasingly important attack surface, as evidenced by the Spectre and Meltdown attacks. We explore novel approaches to detect and mitigate side channel attacks in software and hardware.

Information flow security: Information flow security constrains the flow of information in a computer system to preserve the confidently and integrity of data. We explore proving the absence of information flow errors in complex computer system.

Type errors and dynamic errors: Localizing program errors (both static and and dynamic errors) is still an extremely time consuming task. We look for general and precise methods for localizing errors based Bayesian reasoning.
