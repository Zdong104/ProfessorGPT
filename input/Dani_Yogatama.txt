Dani Yogatama

I am a cofounder and CEO of Reka and an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California.

I was a senior staff research scientist at DeepMind (2016-2022). Prior to DeepMind, I was at Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab (2015-2016). I received my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University (2010-2015) where I was advised by Noah Smith as a member of Noah's ARK. I was a Monbukagakusho (文部科学省) fellow at the University of Tokyo (2008-2010) in Tanaka-Ishii's Lab. I grew up in Indonesia and went to Institut Teknologi Bandung.
