Projects
Urban Deep Generative Modeling

Dr. Aliaga is a pioneer in the area of inverse procedural modeling for urban spaces, with his first paper introducing the topic in 2005/2007. His vision is to facilitate semi-automatic and controllable content creation and edition of large and complex geometric models for use in digital simulation, visualization, entertainment, education, and cultural heritage by converting unstructured data into organized and easily editable procedural representations. While a significant benefit of procedural modeling is its detail amplification, it is very difficult to develop a compact expressive set of procedural rules. To this end, his group has innovated many automatic methods to infer procedural model rules and parameter values from 3D models, sketches, images, point clouds, roads, facades, buildings, cities, and vegetation. More recently, this approach now includes the use of various forms of deep generative modeling and is still an active area of research. Dr. Aliaga has published surveys, given talks and tutorials (e.g., at SIGGRAPH, CVPR and Eurographics) on this topic.

Urban Modeling and Simulation

In this multi-disciplinary project, Dr. Aliaga's group has since 2009 collaborated with numerous experts in urban planning, atmospheric/geological sciences, civil engineering, architecture, hydrology, and transportation engineering to capture, simulate, and modify models of urban environments. Today, more than half of the world's population of 7 billion people lives in cities - and that number is only expected to grow. Cities, and urban spaces of all sizes, are however extremely complex and their modeling is still not solved. Dr. Aliaga pursues urban visual computing and artificial intelligence (AI) tools for improving the complex urban ecosystem and for "what-if" exploration of sustainable urban designs, including integrating urban 3D modeling, simulation, meteorology, vegetation, and traffic modeling. To date, he has developed several algorithms, deployed cyberinfrastructure prototypes using ground-level imagery, aerial imagery, satellite imagery, GIS data, and forward and inverse procedural modeling to create/modify 3D and 2D urban models, given numerous international talks, TEDx talk, and driven-forward global efforts (e.g., WUDAPT).

Imaging and Reconstruction

Dr. Aliaga has developed multiple novel image processing and image-based 3D reconstruction methods. In particular, Dr. Aliaga created the photogeometric structured light method to perform high-accuracy self-calibrating 3D reconstruction. This work led to 3D spatial augmented reality techniques used to perform visual virtual restoration, showcased in several museum applications. In addition, Dr. Aliaga created a novel method to embed a genuinity signature into the surface of 3D objects to detect counterfeiting and tampering. Further, Dr. Aliaga developed custom displays and image rendering methods to compensate for human visual aberrations.
