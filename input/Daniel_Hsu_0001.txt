I work on algorithmic statistics and machine learning. My research is part of broader efforts in Foundations of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Theory of Computation at Columbia.

If you are a (current or prospective) student interested in coming to Columbia and/or working with me on research, or if you are generally interested in getting started in machine learning and/or research, please check this page of frequent answers to questions.

My papers can be found by following this link. (See also arXiv, dblp, Google Scholar.)
