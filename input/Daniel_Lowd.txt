I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Oregon.

My research interests include learning and inference with probabilistic graphical models, adversarial machine learning, and statistical relational machine learning.

You can also find me on BlueSky (@lowd.bsky.social), Twitter (@dlowd) and Mastodon (@lowd@sigmoid.social).
