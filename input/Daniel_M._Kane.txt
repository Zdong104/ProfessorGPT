Research


I have broad research interests within mathematics and theoretical computer science. While my research covers a wide range of topics my mathematics work tends to be within the broad areas of number theory and combinatorics, while my computer science research tends to be about derandomization, Boolean functions (with particular emphasis on polynomial threshold functions), or machine learning. For the past few years, the bulk of my research has been in computational statistics. In particular, I have a recent book on robust statistics with Ilias Diakonikolas to be published by Cambridge University Press.
