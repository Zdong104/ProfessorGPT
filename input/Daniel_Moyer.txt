About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. Please reach out if you want to collaborate!

I previously was a Post-Doc at MIT CSAIL working with Polina Golland, and prior to that a CS grad student at USC under Greg Ver Steeg and Paul Thompson. My research is focused on machine learning and its applications to medical imaging.
