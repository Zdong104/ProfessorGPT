Three-phase Paper Writing

An algorithm for writing technical papers

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Brown University, where I co-lead the Brown Visual Computing group. My research sits at the intersection of computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning—especially how AI and ML tools can make the process of creating graphics content easier, more accessible, and more enjoyable. I'm particularly interested in technologies for creating, manipulating, and analyzing 3D shapes and scenes, and these days I'm excited about neurosymbolic methods for doing so (combining the best aspects of procedural models and deep neural networks). My research is funded by gifts from Adobe, Autodesk, Pixar, and NVIDIA, as well as grants from DARPA and the National Science Foundation, including an NSF CAREER Award.

I received my PhD from Stanford University, where I worked with Pat Hanrahan in the Graphics Lab and with Noah Goodman in the Computation and Cognition Lab. I received my undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley.

My Erdős number is 4 (Daniel Ritchie → Niloy Mitra → Leonidas Guibas → Boris Aronov → Paul Erdős). My Bacon number is 3, though only if you count all film credits, not just cast appearances (Daniel Ritchie → John Lasseter → Tom Hanks → Kevin Bacon). This (debatably) makes my Erdős-Bacon number 7.

News
July 2024
I'll be at SIGGRAPH 2024. I'll be running a BoF on PhD student mentoring (submit topics for discussion here) and helping out with the thesis fast forward. Oh, and if you have a paper that features a creative use of the SIGGRAPH logo, don't forget to submit to the SIGGRAPH Logo Gallery. See you in Denver!
July 2024
Paper (with fantastic SFU collaborators) about a new 3D scene dataset accepted to ECCV 2024! Code and data coming soon.
June 2024
I'll be at SGP on Saturday (6/22) teaching a course and again on Monday (6/24). Hit me up if you'd like to meet!
