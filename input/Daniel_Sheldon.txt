About Me
I am an associate professor in the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research investigates fundamental problems in machine learning and applied algorithms motivated by large-scale environmental data, dynamic ecological processes, and real-world network phenoemena.
Previously, I had a joint appointment at Mount Holyoke College. Before that, I was a postdoc at Oregon State University, where I held a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship in Bioinformatics. I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Cornell University.
