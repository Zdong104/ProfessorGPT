Daphne Ippolito

I am an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. I study the tradeoffs and limitations of generating text with neural language models, as well as strategies for evaluating natural language generation systems. I also research how to incorporate AI-in-the-loop language generation into assistive tools for writers. I completed my PhD at University of Pennsylvania, co-advised by Professor Chris Callison-Burch at UPenn and Principal Scientist Douglas Eck at Google Brain.  You can read my dissertation here.

In 2022, I was on the academic job market.  Here were my job market materials from then.
