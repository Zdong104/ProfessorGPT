Measuring and Improving Internet Security

Associate Professor Computer Science
Co-Chair, CS Undergraduate Honors Program


Originally, the Internet was a collaborative effort among researchers, but has since evolved into a marketplace comprising millions of commercial entities and billions of users who often have conflicting goals. My work builds off of the belief that we can secure the Internet by understanding and accounting for these competing interests.

I empirically measure security on the Internet to understand how security breaks down, and I apply economics and cryptography to design and build new systems with provable and usable security. I study the web's PKI, censorship avoidance, DNS root servers, and more. I have been fortunate to work with many wonderful collaborators. See my CV for more information.

I'm looking for students
	

I am an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland. I am looking for ambitious, motivated PhD and undergraduate students to work with. If you're interested in systems and network security, then:

Our paper on "Weaponizing Middleboxes for Reflected TCP Amplification" received an Internet Defense Prize! Thank you to USENIX and Facebook for this award.

Research

My research measures and improves real-world security. I envision an Internet where users have greater control and understanding of what happens to their data. Recently, I've been studying the web's certificate ecosystem, cloud computing, and censorship-avoidance.

Teaching

Fall 2023, I'm teaching:

CMSC 614: Graduate Security
CMSC 396H: Undergrad Honors Seminar

I also helped design and run the Build it, break it, fix it secure programming competition that gives students firsthand experience with building secure code.

All My Classes
Service

I'm on the committees for IEEE S&P 2023 (Oakland) and PAM 2020. Submit your work!

I was the General Chair for ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) 2021", the ACM Symposium on SDN Research (SOSR) 2017, and HotNets 2013. I regularly serve on program committees and NSF panels, and have also visited Congress to discuss increasing nationwide funding for scientific research.
