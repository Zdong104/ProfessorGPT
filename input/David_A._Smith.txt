Office hours: by appointment

With colleagues in CS, Social Sciences, and Humanities, I am a founding member of the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks, Northeastern's research center for the digital humanities and computational social sciences. My research focus is on natural language processing and computational linguistics, with applications to machine translation, information retrieval, the social sciences, and humanities.

Recent news: The Mellon Foundation has funded the University of Illinois, Washington University in St. Louis, and Northeastern University to study the spread of news about racial terror and anti-Black violence.

The Mellon Foundation funded Northeastern to craft a research agenda for historical and multilingual OCR in the humanities. Read our final report, with recommendations for computer science and humanities researchers, libraries, and funders. This led to follow-up work on Arabic-script OCR funded by the Mellon and NEH.

The Institute for Museum and Library Sciences and funding agencies in five other countries have granted $1.2M to our new Oceanic Exchanges project to track news and ideas across countries and languages.

Our NEH-funded Viral Texts project on viral networks in 19th-century newspapers was featured in Wired. Our work analyzing text reuse in bills in the US Congress was featured in the Economist.

Until August 2012, I was a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Formerly: Natural Language Processing at Johns Hopkins University; and Head Programmer, Perseus Project, Tufts University
