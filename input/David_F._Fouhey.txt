Summary: I am an Assistant Professor at NYU, jointly appointed between Computer Science in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Tandon School of Engineering.

From 2019 to 2023, I was an Assistant Professor at CSE at the University of Michigan. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, working with Alyosha Efros and Jitendra Malik. Before that, I received a Ph.D. in robotics from CMU where I worked with Abhinav Gupta and Martial Hebert.

About Joining My Group

I am always looking for motivated and talented students. I also receive hundreds of emails a day and cannot respond to inquiries about joining my group and generally do not. This is not meant to be unfriendly, but just so you can obtain information that is likely of interest to you.
If you are looking to become a NYU PhD student: I will be admitting students in CS and ECE for the Fall 2024 PhD application season (i.e., submitting an application in December 2024 to start in September 2025). Please apply directly to whichever has a closer fit to your interests and list my name. I am particularly looking for a student in AI for astrophysics. In practice, that means that I am looking for: (a) strong experience in machine learning or imaging (e.g., inverse problems), (b) enthusiasm for large-scale data and systems, (c) willingness to get deep into the weeds on data and pay attention to details; (d) and experience or strong interest in astrophysics or related problems like radiative transfer.

Note: There is no need to email me. I look at all applications when they come, after the application deadline, looking at the full application pool. I will then reach out directly as needed. Emailing me in advance genuinely does not improve your chances of admission. This is not some test where only the truly motivated email me.


If you are a NYU student looking for research: I am not taking on direct advisees at this point. Please feel free to email any of my PhD students if you think there is a good research fit.


If you are a UM student: I am not taking new students at UM.


Otherwise: at the moment, I am not generally looking for postdocs, visitors, or new collaborators except via people I already have a connection with.

Executive Summary

Research: I work on learning-based computer vision. I want to develop autonomous systems that can learn to build representations of the underlying state and dynamics of the world through observation. I am particularly interested in the following three areas:
Understanding 3D from pictorial cues. One of my goals for the past ten years has been enabling computers to perceive the 3D world with the same ease that humans do. I'm broadly interested in this area, and as our ability to extract 3D from images has gotten better, I've become increasingly interested in how to optimally use this information in the context of multiple views.

Representative projects: (1) Sparse View Planar Reconstruction investigates a wide-baseline problem that falls in between areas that computer vision knows how to do well; (2) Direct Ray Distance Functions shows how to produce full-3D reconstructions while learning on realistic non-watertight 3D data.


Understanding the Interactive World. While images are themselves static, they depict a world of possibility in which we can move about and manipulate the world. I would like to give computers the ability to perceive this world and have focused on understanding interactions as they occur, from the perspective of hands and 3D.

Representative projects: (1) 100 Days of Hands, a system that aims to provide basic information about hands that just works on fairly unconstrained data. Our system has been adopted by EPIC-KITCHENS; (2) Understanding Articulation in Videos shows how to extract a quantitative understanding of interacting 3D from ordinary videos for a common class of objects.


Measurement systems for basic sciences, especially solar physics. I have collaboratated with experts in other fields to build ML-based systems for measurements for basic science. One focus has been virtual instruments for solar physics that enhance the value of space missions. Developing and verifying systems that collaborators like requires long-term investment, and is intensely satisfying.

Representative projects: (1) SynthIA, a best-of-both worlds learning-based magnetogram system currently being integrated into the SDO pipeline for distribution as a data product; (2) Skelevision, a deep learning approach to measuring museum skeletal specimens, which we hope will let us ask questions about the relationship between temperature and bird morphology at unprecedented scales.
