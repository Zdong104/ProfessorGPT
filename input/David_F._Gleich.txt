My research is on high performance and large scale computations with a focus on enabling previously infeasible analysis of data from biology, social networks, and scientific simulations. I find stating and studying these problems as large scale matrix computations productive. I received an NSF CAREER award to discover how to scale matrix methods to the enormous sizes of modern data with only modest computational resources. Prior to joining Purdue, I was the John von Neumann post-doctoral fellow at Sandia National Labs.

NEWS HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE LAST 5-ISH YEARS.
2023-12-01 We have a paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence on topological analysis of neural networks, read about it in IEEE Spectrum or Purdue News
2021-01-22 A nice summary of some recent ideas in higher-order analysis from SIAM News Higher-order Network Analysis Takes Off, Fueled by Old Ideas and New Data
2020-09-21 Behind-the-scenes videos: Our correlation clustering work Using cliques to draw graphs
2018-07-10 I'm very honored that SIAM selected my paper, PageRank Beyond the Web for a 2018 SIAM Outstanding Paper Prize
RECENT INTERESTS
Higher-order methods for analyzing data
Algorithmic Anti-differentiation
Network diffusions including PageRank, heat kernels
Spectral graph theory
High performance computers
Large scale data computations
Community detection and clustering
Matrix-based network computations
About a decade ago, I wrote an article for ACM's XRDS magazine on some of the issues that
arise in my research. It's a nice overview of issues I'm looking at
and problems I'm studying.
