Latest Research
MemC3: Compact and Concurrent Memcache with Dumber Caching and Smarter Hashing
This paper introduces a new mechanism for memory-efficient, multi-reader concurrent hashing, called optimistic cuckoo hashing, and uses it to make Memcached scale better, run faster, and use less memory.
Stronger Semantics for Low-Latency Geo-Replicated Storage
This NSDI 2013 paper presents Eiger, a follow-on system to our earlier work on causally consistent geo replicated storage in COPS. Eiger improves upon cops by supporting Cassandra's rich data model (instead of just a basic key-value store); supporting write transactions in addition to read transactions; and fixing the problem in COPS of an unsightly buildup of state if one of the datacenters fails.
Research

My research interests are in computer systems in the networked environment. I have a particular interest in exploring the systems and data structure response to evolving hardware trends near the end of Moore's law, memory and power-efficient computing, and robust distributed systems.

About me

I completed my Ph.D. at MIT in December 2004. Prior to that, I received an MS in computer science from MIT in 2001, and BS degrees in biology and computer science from the University of Utah. In 1995, I co-founded an Internet Service Provider in Salt Lake City, Utah. My blog is online. (as is my old blog.)

Non-Research Software
coursegen - a small set of ruby scripts/etc. to semi-auto-generate course web pages. Takes a YAML input of the list of classes, topics, etc., for the semester and outputs HTML and an iCal file. This is what generated the pages for my above-linked courses.
paper_skel - the LaTeX template my research group uses for starting papers. Emits USENIX and ACM systems conference style-compatible PDF with less ugliness than the default ACM style file.
Random Things
Dave's guide to Running in Pittsburgh - I have a bit of a running problem, so I put together a list of nice runs in the area.
My list and map of running routes in Boston
The Usable Mac - my collection of things to make my mac use a little more efficient (and bring in some unixy goodness). 2nd half is CMU specific - integrating with kerberos/AFS/etc.
The Pi Searcher - search for arbitrary substrings in the first 200 million digits of Pi.
Compound interest calculators of various sorts - I got sick of bloated, ad-laden sites for these that didn't do what I wanted and that didn't work well on my phone.
