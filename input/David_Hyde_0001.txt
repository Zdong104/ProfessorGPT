Brief bio: David Hyde is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. He was first a Regents Scholar at UCSB, earning a B.S. in Mathematics with highest honors at age 19. Hyde then earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science (with Distinction in Teaching) from Stanford, where he was a DoD NDSEG Fellow and a Gerald J. Lieberman Fellow. He also earned M.S. degrees in computer science and applied math. Most recently, David was a PIC Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA. Hyde's research has been supported by organizations including DARPA, the Department of Energy, and the Army Research Lab. He is a recipient of the ORAU Ralph E. Powe Junior Faculty Enhancement Award and was a SIAM Science Policy Fellow from 2022-2024. Hyde has also helped build successful technology companies and invests in startups via Brave Capital.

Research summary: Professor Hyde leads the Simulation, Optimization, and Learning (SOL) laboratory at Vanderbilt University. His group creates new algorithms and numerical methods for problems in and at the intersections of these three fields. A particular emphasis is on developing techniques for simulating physical phenomena that involve solids and fluids. These simulations are useful for engineering and computer graphics, as well as for providing data and constraints for learning-based systems. Hyde and his group also build cloud computing platforms, create scalable heterogeneous implementations of algorithms, and develop practical software, libraries, and datasets relevant to their research focus. The SOL lab ultimately seeks to illuminate the synergies between simulation, learning, and data, and to leverage these connections to solve complex real-world challenges.
