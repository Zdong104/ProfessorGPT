About MUMSI (the squirrel)

Squirrels abound on the beautiful University of Michigan campus, and the School of Information adopted a VR-goggled squirrel as its unofficial mascot in 2018. Students, faculty and staff voted to name our squirrel MUMSI, which is a mashup of the famous Michigan Block M logo and UMSI (the abbreviation for the University of Michigan School of Information). MUMSI’s virtual reality headset reflects how the two, viewed together, became MUMSI.
