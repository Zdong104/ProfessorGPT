David S. Rosenblum is Planning Research Corporation Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University.

Professor Rosenblum received his PhD in 1988 from Stanford University. From 1988 to 1996 he was a Member of the Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories (now AT&T Labs Research) in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and from 1996 to 2001 he was on the Faculty of the Department (now School) of Information and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine. From 2001 to 2003 he was Chief Technology Officer and Principal Architect of PreCache, a startup company developing technology in the area of publish/subscribe networking. From 2004 to 2011 he was Professor of Software Systems in the Department of Computer Science at University College London. From 2011 to 2020 he was a Professor of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, where he served as Dean of the NUS School of Computing from 2013 to 2016 and Director of the NUS-Singtel Cyber Security Research and Development Laboratory from 2016 to 2020.

Professor Rosenblum's research has addressed a wide range of problems spanning the breadth of the software development life cycle, including software specification, architecture, design, verification, testing, analysis and maintenance. His current research focuses on the use of machine learning in the design and testing of mobile, context-aware adaptive systems for ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things. In 1997 he received a CAREER Award from the US National Science Foundation for his work on distributed component-based software, and from 2004-2009 he held a Wolfson Research Merit Award from the Royal Society.

Professor Rosenblum is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE and has received two test-of-time awards for his research. He was previously Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM) and an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE). He has served as Member-at-Large, Vice Chair, Chair and Past Chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT), and in 2018 he received the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award.
