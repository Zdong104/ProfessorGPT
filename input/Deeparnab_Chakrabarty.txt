Associate Professor of Computer Science

I study algorithms. Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for solving computational problems that can range from adding two numbers to predicting the weather. My research area is understanding the efficiency and limitations of algorithms, thereby delineating the boundary between tractable and intractable computational problems.
