Greetings! I am an assistant professor at Stevens Institute of Technology.

I’m looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students to work with me in data science and LLM for business analytics. Feel free to shoot me an email with your CV. Once we have a commitment to each other, I will exert my utmost effort to help you!

I received my Ph.D. at Rutgers University, advised by Prof. Hui Xiong. My research interests lie in the intersection of data mining, natural langauge processing and business intelligence. More recently, I study the interaction between LLM, business, ethics, social impact and innovation.

My work has been published in top venues of data mining, artificial intelligence and information systems, including refereed journals (IEEE TKDE, IEEE BigData) and conference proceedings (KDD, AAAI, ICDM, CIKM, CIST, etc.). Some of my working papers are under review for UTD and FT50 journals.
