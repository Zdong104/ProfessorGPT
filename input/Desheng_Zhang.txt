RA Positions Available

There are several graduate RA positions available in my group starting 2023 Fall. If you are interested in Data Science, Cyber-Physical Systems, or Internet of Things, please send me your CV (for existing RU students) or mention my name in the cover letter of your application (for prospective students).

Sabbatical at MIT

Starting September 2020, I have been taking my sabbatical at MIT Media Lab working with Prof. Alex 'Sandy' Pentland and his group for the Connection Science program. Please contact me at desheng at mit.edu for the MIT related project.

Short Biography

Desheng is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University and a Visiting Professor at MIT. Previously, Desheng was offered the Senseable City Consortium Postdoctoral Fellowship from MIT, and awarded his Ph.D in Computer Science from University of Minnesota.

Desheng is interested in bridging Cyber Physical Systems, Cyber Human Systems, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Large Models, in Extreme-Scale Data-Intensive Urban Infrastructure from an Interdisciplinary perspective with extensive applications from transportation, to communication, and sharing economy. He is focused on the life cycle of data-driven systems, from mobile sensing, to cross-domain data fusion and prediction, decision making, visual data analytics, system optimization and deployment. He strategically positions his research on Real-Time Interactions of Cross-Domain Urban Platforms and their human users, i.e., on-demand delivery (e.g., UberEat, Doordash, Instacart) transportation (e.g., taxis, buses, trucks, subways, bikes, personal & electric vehicles), telecommunication (e.g., cellphones), payment (e.g., smartcards), social networks (e.g., check-in and app logs). He has been investigating platforms across 8 cities on 3 continents with 100 thousand app users, 500 thousand vehicles, 10 million phones, 16 million smartcards, and 100 million residents involved.

His technical contributions have led to more than 100 papers in premium CS venues, e.g., IMWUT/UbiComp, MobiCom, SIGCOMM, KDD, SenSys, NSDI, ICDE, SIGSPATIAL, IPSN, ICCPS, BigData, RTSS, ICDCS. Desheng has been honored with 8 best paper/thesis/poster awards.

During his free time, Desheng likes to travel. Here is a road map about cities he has been visited so far in US. 


During his free time, Desheng also likes to read non-fiction books. Here is a List of Six Recommended Books for 2020. 


Research Group

At Rutgers Computer Science, Desheng is leading a research group called ARSENAL (shorted for AlgoRithms, SystEms, Networking, datA Lab) with 10 Ph.D. working on different subareas of CPS, Data Science, Ubiquitous and Mobile Sensing, HCI, Applied Machine Learning.
