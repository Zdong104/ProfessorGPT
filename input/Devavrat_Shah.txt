Research Interest

My current research focus is Social Data Processing (see here) with a particular interest in practical algorithms for Statistical inference. Over years, I have been interested in distributed network algorithms, stochastic networks and network information theory. The primary challenge that has been driving my research is the need for designing high-performant, extremely simple algorithms under severe resource constraints.
