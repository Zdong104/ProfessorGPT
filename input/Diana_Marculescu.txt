About Me
I am currently the Chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, a Professor of ECE and holder of the Motorola Regents Chair in ECE #2. I am also the Founding Director of the iMAGiNE (Intelligent Machine Engineering) Consortium, a joint industry-university partnership for engineering the machines that support intelligent applications from cloud to edge.

Before joining UT Austin in December 2019, I was the David Edward Schramm Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Together with my research group (ENergY Aware Computing, EnyAC) I do work on sustainable computing and computing for sustainability or life science applications. I teach courses on energy aware computing, computer architecture, and design automation and have advised more than a dozen doctoral students, 35+ master students, and more than two dozen undergrads.

Between 2015-2019, I served as the Founding Director of the College of Engineering Center for Faculty Success at Carnegie Mellon University, an on-campus umbrella center for providing engineering faculty access to resources on mentoring, professional development, and leadership training.
