Biography

I am an assistant professor at UPenn’s GRASP lab, with a primary appointment in CIS, and a secondary appointment in ESE. I lead the Perception, Action, and Learning (PAL) Research Group, where we work on problems at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.

Bio: Here is a bio page that can be used for talks.

Research Statement: My research statement explains our research vision.

Teaching: Here are the past courses I have taught.

[posted Apr 17, 2024] We’re recruiting TAs for CIS 5190 Applied Machine Learning for Fall ‘24, co-taught by me and Mingmin Zhao. If you are interested, please fill out this form. We expect the course to follow the outline from recent offerings, such as this one.

For prospective masters and undergraduate students: If you’re an undergraduate or MS student interested in collaborating with our PAL research group, please complete this form. We monitor responses regularly, and will reach out to you if there’s an opening. Women and underrepresented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.

For prospective PhD students: Formal admissions are processed through the university’s various programs. You may send me email too, but please note that I might not be able to respond.
