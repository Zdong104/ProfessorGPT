I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford, affiliated with the Stanford NLP Group, Stanford HCI Group, Stanford AI Lab (SAIL), and Stanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). I am interested in Socially Aware Natural Language Processing. My research goal is to better understand human communication in social context and build socially aware language technologies to support human-human and human-computer interaction.

Prospective students and postdocs, please check out this page on how to get involved.
