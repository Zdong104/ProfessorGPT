I work mostly in artificial intelligence: commonsense reasoning; flexible, domain-general, self-adjusting autonomous systems; and philosophical issues surrounding language, mind, consciousness. Much of this work is conducted collaboratively with students and colleagues; the primary current thrust aims to test our ambitious "commonsense-core hypothesis" (see links below). This research is largely supported by external grants, such as from NSF, ONR, ARO, and AFOSR.
