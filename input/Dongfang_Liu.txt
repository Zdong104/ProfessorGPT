ABOUT ME

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering and an affiliated faculty member with Computer Science department. My research interests primarily revolve around general-purpose AI. Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of working alongside a cohort of exceptionally bright and talented students who have accompanied me on this academic journey. Sometimes, they listen to me. I have a charming feline companion üêà that graces my life, Mr. Tiger, who brings a lot of joy to the family.

RESEARCH INTERESTS

My research endeavors have been dedicated to the development of general intelligence for X tailored to address interdisciplinary challenges (e.g., autonomous driving, cancer diagnosis, and sustainable energy). Through these multidisciplinary investigations, I strive to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and the resolution of pressing issues across diverse disciplines (e.g., transportation, health care, and inertial confinement fusion). These endeavors have garnered support from National Science Foundation (NSF) and indurstial partners. By harnessing the power of AI, I aim to unravel complexities, devise innovative strategies, and ultimately make substantial contributions to the betterment of society. I am continuously looking for doctoral students to work with my research projects. If you want to develop awesome AI tools to address real-world problems, I think we need to talk üòÑ.

RESEARCH PROJECTS

Project 1: Vision-Anchored Automation of Bird-Sized UAVs in Unknown Cluttered Indoor Environments
The research project aims to develop full automation for bird-sized UAVs using only an RGB-D camera, and seeks to answer fundamental questions for UAV automation, including constructing visual perception and developing visual navigation.
