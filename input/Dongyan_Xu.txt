Welcome to Dongyan Xu's home page. I am a Samuel Conte Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University, where I joined in 2001 as an assistant professor. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, under the direction of Professor Klara Nahrstedt. I am a recipient of six Seed for Success Awards from Purdue University, a CAREER Award from NSF, eight Best Paper/Student Paper Awards from RAID'08, SOCC'11, ASE'13, USENIX Security'14, CCS'15, NDSS'16, USENIX Security'17, and WOOT'20. I was a Purdue University Faculty Scholar from 2012 to 2017. I received the College of Science Undergraduate Advising (2008), Graduate Advising (2014), Leadership (2013, 2016), Research (2015), and Team (2015, 2017) Awards.

I am the Director of CERIAS, Purdue's cybersecurity research and education center. I served as Head of the Department of Computer Science in Fall 2019.

The three components of my professional life:
