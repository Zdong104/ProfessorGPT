I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and control theory. Specifically, my group is interested in developing efficient algorithms for safe, reliable, and adaptive human-robot and generally multi-agent interactions. I have received my doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley in 2017, and have received my bachelor’s degree in EECS at UC Berkeley in 2012.
