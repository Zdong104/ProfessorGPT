Bio

Doug L. James is a Full Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University (since June 2015), and a member of Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) and the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME). He holds three degrees in applied mathematics, including a Ph.D. in 2001 from the University of British Columbia. In 2002 he joined the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University as an Assistant Professor, and later became an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University (2006-2015). His research interests include computer graphics, computer sound, physically based modeling and animation, and reduced-order physics models. Doug is a recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER award, and a fellow of both the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation. He received the ACM SIGGRAPH 2021 Computer Graphics Achievement Award, a 2012 Technical Achievement Award from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for "Wavelet Turbulence," and the 2013 Katayanagi Emerging Leadership Prize from Carnegie Mellon University and Tokyo University of Technology. He was the Technical Papers Program Chair of ACM SIGGRAPH 2015, and a consulting Senior Research Scientist at Pixar Animation Studios from 2015-2020. Since 2022 he has been a consulting Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA.
