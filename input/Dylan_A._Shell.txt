Short Bio

Dylan Shell is an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. He received his BSc degree in computational & applied mathematics and computer science from the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. His research aims to synthesize and analyze complex, intelligent behavior in distributed systems that exploit their physical embedding to interact with the physical world.

He has published papers on multi-robot task allocation, robotics for emergency scenarios, biologically inspired multiple robot systems, multi-robot routing, estimation of group-level swarm properties, statistical mechanics for robot swarms, minimalist manipulation, wireless communication models for robot systems, interpolation for adaptive robotic sampling, rigid-body simulation and contact models, human-robot interaction, and robotic theatre.

 




I rather enjoy this image. It seems to imply that even from the moment Karel Čapek coined the word robot, tedious maintenance was anticipated. As a rule I insist on wearing a flat cap whilst tinkering on robots. But, alas, my students appear to think this faddish and have opted to eschew this well-meaning example.
