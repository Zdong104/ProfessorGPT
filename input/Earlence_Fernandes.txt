I'm an Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Diego in the Computer Science and Engineering department. My goal is to enable society to gain the benefits of emerging technologies without the security and privacy risks. I have received two best paper awards (at IEEE S&P and IEEE SecDev), the NSF CAREER award, and research awards from Facebook, Amazon and Google. My work has been featured in Wired, The Verge, Ars Technica, Science Magazine and Nature. It is also on display at the Science Museum in London (One of the experimental artifacts is now part of the Science Museum's permanent collection). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan in 2017 where I was advised by Prof. Atul Prakash. Before coming to UC San Diego, I spent three excellent years at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
