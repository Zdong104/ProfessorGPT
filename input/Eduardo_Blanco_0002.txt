I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Arizona. I am also affiliated with Applied Math.

My primary research interests lie in natural language processing with an emphasis on computational semantics. I am a member of the Computational Language Understanding Lab and the NLP cluster at the University of Arizona.

I sometimes tweet. For the cool work coming out of the lab, check out @labclu.
