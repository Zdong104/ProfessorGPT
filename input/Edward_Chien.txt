Overview

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science here at Boston University.

Research interests: geometry processing, computational fabrication, hex meshing, optimal transport, harmonic and bounded distortion mappings

I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2015 from Rutgers University under Prof. Feng Luo, studying low-dimensional topology and geometry. More specifically, my thesis constructed square tilings of surfaces arising from discrete harmonic differential 1-forms.

Afterwards, I transitioned to applied work, working as a postdoc with Prof. Ofir Weber at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. While there, I focused on harmonic and bounded distortion methods for mapping, parametrization, and interpolation.

For my second postdoc, I returned to the States for three years in the Geometric Data Processing Group at MIT, led by Prof. Justin Solomon. There I began research in hex meshing and applied optimal transport. My work continues in these directions today, with a recent focus on applications in computational fabrication. I have thoroughly enjoyed combining my theoretical training with complex engineering problems.
