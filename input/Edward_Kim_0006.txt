About me

I am currently an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Drexel University. I graduated with a Ph.D. in 2013 from the IDEA Lab supervised by Dr. Sharon Xiaolei Huang. My current research interests are computer vision, sparse coding, neuromorphic computing, and multimodal machine learning. I recieved an NSF CAREER award in 2019.

Academic Lab

I run the SPARSE (SPiking And Recurrent SoftwarE) Coding Lab @ Drexel University. This lab is inspired by breakthroughs in computational and theoretical neuroscience that incorporate ideas not explored by current feed-forward deep learning architectures.
