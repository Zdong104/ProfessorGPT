My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, with a particular emphasis on sublinear algorithms, complexity theory, coding theory and learning theory. My recent work has focused on the following goals:
designing algorithms that only use sublinear time or sublinear space, in computational models relevant to large data sets
understanding the complexity of fundamental problems on error-correcting codes and point lattices, with applications to communications, cryptography and optimizations
understanding information-theoretical limits of computation in diverse models.
