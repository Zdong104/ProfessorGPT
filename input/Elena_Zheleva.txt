RESEARCH INTERESTS

My research spans different aspects of data science, including machine learning, causal inference, graph mining, network science, and privacy. My research goal is to unify these aspects in a single framework that allows us to reason better with data and solve important societal problems. I am especially interested in algorithms for heterogeneous graphs and networks, with focus on the following goals:

Identify and resolve barriers to causal inference from relational data for real-world applications
Improve machine learning models by addressing inherent biases in (found) data
Empower people in their privacy choices through personalized privacy assistants

I am motivated by compelling applications, and some of the areas that I study are personalization, social media, social networks, psychology, journalism, and e-commerce.




If you are a prospective student interested to work with me, you need to apply to the CS Ph.D. program. If you are already admitted to the program, send me an email with your interests and CV. You may also want to read this article on how to be a successful Ph.D. student.

BIO

I am an associate professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My research focuses on the intersection of causal inference and machine learning for network data, with applications in graph mining, recommender systems and privacy. I received an NSF CAREER Award in 2021. Prior to joining UIC, I spent a few years in industry as a data scientist, working on large-scale recommender systems, personalization, incentivized sharing, and data science tools for journalists. I built and led the data science team at LivingSocial, and later was a principal data scientist at Vox Media. I also spent a year in government as an AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow at the National Science Foundation, contributing to national initiatives at the intersection of data science and public policy. Many of the research problems I am interested to solve are informed by my industry and public policy experience. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2011 from the University of Maryland, College Park where my advisor was Lise Getoor.
