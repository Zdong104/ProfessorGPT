Summary

I am an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and the director of the Causal Artificial Intelligence Lab at Columbia University. I obtained my Ph.D. under Judea Pearl from the University of California, Los Angeles. I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics, Robotics, Cognitive Science, and Philosophy of Science.

My research focuses on causal inference and its applications to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science, including in the health and social sciences. I am particularly interested in understanding how to make robust and generalizable interventional and counterfactual claims in the context of heterogeneous and biased data collections, including due to issues of confounding bias, selection bias, dataset shift, and external validity (transportability). A survey of recent developments on this topic, when combining massive sets of research data, appeared at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), see the story and the paper. A brief summary of the automated scientist project was also highlighted at the IEEE Intelligent Systems (link, story). For an overview of my thoughts on causal data science (as of April 2019), watch the talk I gave at Columbia University, link. For some of the latest results on this topic, please refer to (UAI-19, ICML-19a, b, NeurIPS-19, AAAI-20a, b, ICML-20, NeurIPS-20, NeurIPS-21a, b, ICML-22, NeurIPS-23, AAAI-24).

More recently, I have been exploring the intersection of causal inference with decision-making/reinforcement learning (NeurIPS-15, ICML-17, IJCAI-17, NeurIPS-18, AAAI-19, NeurIPS-19, ICML-20, NeurIPS-20a, b, c, NeurIPS-21, CleaR-22, ICLR-23, AAAI-24, ICLR-24), explainability/fairness analysis (AAAI-18, NeurIPS-18, UAI-19, NeurIPS-23a, b, AAAI-24, FnTML-24), and generative models/vision (ACM-22, NeurIPS-21, CVPR-22, ICLR-23, NeurIPS-23, AAAI-24, ICML-24).
