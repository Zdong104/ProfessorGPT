ABOUT

My research interests are broadly in the areas of security and privacy. I use computational, economic, and social science methods to understand & model usersâ€™ safety decision-making processes. I specifically investigate inequities that arise in these processes and work directly with marginalized and at-risk communities to design systems that facilitate safety equitably and respectfully.

Want a brief sample of my work? Check outmy recent essays in Scientific Americanand a talk I gave about using human inputs to improve safety in digital systems.
