ABOUT

I am an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan!

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT through the CSAIL METEOR Fellowship. 

I have a PhD in Computer Science from Harvard University, where I was advised by Prof. Milind Tambe. 

My research interests lie broadly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for social impact, particularly spanning the fields of multi-agent systems and machine learning for conservation and public health.
