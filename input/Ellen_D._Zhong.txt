Short Bio

Ellen Zhong is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. She is interested in problems at the intersection of AI and biology. Her research develops machine learning methods for computational and structural biology problems with a focus on protein structure determination with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). She obtained her Ph.D. from MIT in 2022, advised by Bonnie Berger and Joey Davis, where she developed deep learning algorithms for 3D reconstruction of dynamic protein structures from cryo-EM images. She has interned at DeepMind with John Jumper and the AlphaFold team and previously worked on molecular dynamics algorithms and infrastructure for drug discovery at D. E. Shaw Research. She obtained her B.S. from the University of Virginia where she worked with Michael Shirts on computational methods for studying protein folding.
