ABOUT ME
Currently, I am a professor at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University in Boston.

Previously, I was tenured faculty at Institute Eurecom (Graduate School and Research Center) in the French Riviera and before that, faculty at the Technical University of Vienna where I co-founded the Secure Systems Lab. Our lab has now become international and is distributed over nine institutions and geographical locations.

My current research interests are in systems, software and network security (with focus on Web security, binary analysis, malware detection). Before that, I was mainly interested in distributed systems, software engineering and software architectures.

I am very fortunate to work with and have the privilege to advise some very bright Ph.D. students. I am very proud of their achievements! I've also been fortunate to work with some very smart and technically capable post-docs and collaborators around the world.

I personally enjoy writing code in different languages (e.g., C, Perl, C#, Java, [recently] Python) and am convinced that computer science students need to be language-independent ;-) I am trying to continue to code as much as possible -- although I have much more admin work to do now...

I am also part of the Shellphish hacking group. We regularly participate at the DefCon CTF.
