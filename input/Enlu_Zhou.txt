Enlu Zhou is a Fouts Family Professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech. She received the B.S. degree with highest honors in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2009. Prior to joining Georgia Tech in 2013, she was an assistant professor in the Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign from 2009-2013. She is a recipient of the Best Theoretical Paper award at the Winter Simulation Conference, AFOSR Young Investigator award, NSF CAREER award, and INFORMS Outstanding Simulation Publication Award. She has served as an associate editor for Journal of Simulation, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, and Operations Research. She is currently the President of the INFORMS Simulation Society.

Research Interests

Dr. Zhouâ€™s research interests lie in theory, methods, and applications of simulation, stochastic optimization, and stochastic control. She currently works on the development of efficient algorithms for (i) optimizing and predicting performance of complex systems that are described by stochastic simulation models, and (ii) solving dynamic decision-making problems under uncertainty and driven by data. Her research is at the interface of simulation, control, and optimization. The application areas of her research include machine learning, robotics, systems biology, and financial engineering.
