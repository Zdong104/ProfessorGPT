I have been an associate professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) since July 2022. I earned my Ph.D. in ECE with a minor in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University in Jan 2014 under the supervision of an awesome advisor and person, Prof. A. Kevin Tang. Before joining JHU as an assistant professor in Jan 2016, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for the Mathematics of Information (CMI) in the Computational and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) department at Caltech from 2013 to 2015, where I had the pleasure to be mentored by Prof. Steven Low and Prof. Adam Wierman.
