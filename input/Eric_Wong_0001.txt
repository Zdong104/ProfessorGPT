I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I lead Brachio Lab on debugging machine learning and making systems actually do what we want them to do. I’m also a part of the ASSET Center on safe, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems. Previously, I completed my PhD at CMU advised by Zico Kolter, and did a postdoc with Aleksander Madry.

PhD applicants: If you’re interested, you will need to

Apply to the CIS department
Select me as a potential advisor in your application.

Undergraduates/masters students: If you are a UPenn student and are interested in doing independent machine learning research, then I would recommend (1) take CIS 5200 (2) read this blog post, and (3) fill out this form. We will be in touch if there is a good fit. As a bonus, I would strongly recommend you take my special topics course, 3990-002 Mathematics for Machine Learning so that you are prepared for the mathematics behind the research. If you are not at UPenn, I do not currently have opportunities for external students.

In Fall 2023, I will be teaching a special topics course 3990-002 Mathematics for Machine Learning. See course website here. If you’re interested in doing advanced research or graduate coursework in AI/machine learning but have taken only the core math requirements of the CS degree, then this course is for you.
