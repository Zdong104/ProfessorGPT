Erik Waingarten

I am an assistant professor at Computer and Information Sciences department at the University of Pennsylvania. My research is in algorithms for massive datasets, with a focus on similarity search, streaming/sketching, property testing, and distribution testing. 

Most recently, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford's CS Department, hosted by Moses Charikar and a fellow in the Simons program on "Probability, Geometry, and High Dimensional Computing". I graduated from Columbia University, where I was extremely grateful to have Xi Chen and Rocco Servedio as my advisors.
