About
At Boston University, I'm heading the Human-to-Everything (H2X) Lab. Our overarching goal is to develop intelligent technologies with robust autonomy and real-time assistance capabilities. Our research spans machine intelligence, computer vision, and systems for human-machine interaction (particularly for accessibility).

If you are interested in joining the lab to research machine learning and perception for intelligent systems, please email me your CV.
