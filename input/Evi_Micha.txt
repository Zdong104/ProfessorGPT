CV

I am a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, hosted by Ariel Procaccia. I will start as an Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California, Computer Science Department, in Fall 2024.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer science and economics, and span areas such as algorithmic fairness, computational social choice, mechanism design, algorithmic game theory, and incentives in machine learning.

Previously, I completed my PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I was part of the Theory Group and advised by Nisarg Shah. I was also affiliated with the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society.
