Description: 




I am an Associate Professor of Information and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. My work is at the boundary of HCI and AI. Specific research projects range from modeling behaviors at a very large-scale (search, social networks evolution, learning, meme and rumor spread, programming, text production and consumption, etc.), integration of AI technologies into user-facing interfaces, and work on visualization. Many of these projects are at Internet scales and give me an excuse to work on lots of different things I like... language, creativity, data/text mining, visualizations, social network analysis, etc.

Before grad school I was a researcher at HP Labs' Information Dynamics Group and at Xerox PARC. (recent-ish CV here). Among other things, I am associated with the MISC (HCI-focused) and MIDAS groups. I am one of the founders of ICWSM (which I've chaired multiple times) and have also been Co-General Chair for WSDM and Co-Program Chair for UIST. Work in my group is sponsored by the NSF, IARPA, NIH, the Education Department, Adobe, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo.

I work with some awesome students including: Elsie Lee-Robbins. And some that recently graduated: John Chung (PhD, now at Midjourney), Aria Collopy (PhD, now at RAND), Matt Burgess (PhD, now at Stitch Fix), Srayan Datta (PhD, now at Google), Licia He (PhD, an independent artist), Jessica Hullman (PhD, Associate Professor at Northwestern), Gierad Laput (MSI, PhD at CMU, now at Apple), and Xin Rong (PhD), Hari Subramonyam (PhD, now AI Fellow at Stanford).

I have a blog (which I post to pretty infrequently), twitter account. I tend to load project videos to YouTube (click on "watch in high quality" for a better view)
