About

I am an assistant professor at Department of Computer Science at George Mason University. My research is broadly situated at the interface between machine learning, artificial intelligence, and economics. My current research is largely about multi agent system interacting with information: 1) information elicitation and aggregation mechanisms and 2) multi agent learning.



I am looking for Ph.D. students who are interested in these (and other related) problems from theoretical and applied angles. Please apply to Computer Science at George Mason University and include my name in your application. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in any of my work.

Bio
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering Division from the University of Michigan advised by Grant Schoenebeck. I was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences hosted by Yiling Chen and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the School of Information at the University of Michigan hosted by Grant Schoenebeck.
