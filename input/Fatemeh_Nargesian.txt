Fatemeh Nargesian

I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Rochester. My research interests broadly include databases, data science, and tools for data mining. I work on data management for (fair) AI by developing algorithms and systems for data acquisition from data lakes.

Distribution-aware Data Integration, including responsible data integration and data distribution tailoring
Data Markets, involving distribution-aware and cost-effective query answering
Dataset Discovery: syntactic and semantic joinable and unionable dataset search

I am also interested in scientific time-series management. My goal is to scale the computation of (higher-order) correlations to large-scale and rapidly-updating scientific time-series to enable interactive data exploration in domains such as climate science and neuroscience.

I am always looking for smart, studious, and motivated students who are interested in solving data intelligence problems. If you are interested in doing a PhD with me, send me your research interests and CV. If you are currently an undergraduate at UR, send me your CV and join our group meetings.
