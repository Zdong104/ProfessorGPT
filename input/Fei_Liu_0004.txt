Short Biography

Dr. Fei Liu is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Emory University. Her areas of expertise include natural language processing, deep learning, large language models, and artificial intelligence. Dr. Liu is committed to advancing the state of the art in natural language understanding and generation by developing innovative model architectures, training methodologies, and robust evaluation metrics. With an excess of information available from various sources, Dr. Liu's research plays a vital role in devising efficient techniques to process and make sense of this vast amount of data.

Dr. Liu held a postdoctoral fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University and was a member of Noah's ARK. She also worked as a senior scientist at Bosch Research in Palo Alto, California, where Bosch is one of the largest German companies and a leading provider of intelligent car systems and home appliances. Liu received her Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Texas at Dallas, supported by the Erik Jonsson Distinguished Research Fellowship, and holds bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from Fudan University. Dr. Liu has published over 80 peer-reviewed papers in leading conferences and journals and she regularly serves on the program committees of major international conferences. In 2015, she was selected for the "MIT Rising Stars in EECS" program. Her research has been recognized with several awards, including a Best Paper Award Finalist at WWW 2016, an Area Chair Favorite Paper at COLING 2018, an Amazon AWS Machine Learning Research award in 2020, and NSF's CAREER award in 2022.
