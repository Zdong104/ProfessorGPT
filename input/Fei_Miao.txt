I am looking for self-motivated PhD students with interests and expertise in reinforcement learning, robust optimization, machine learning, control theory, game theory, and cyber-physical systems!

Bio

I am Pratt & Whitney Associate Professor of the School of Computing, a courtesy faculty of the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut. I am also affiliated to Institute for Advanced Systems Engineering, Before joining Uconn, I was a postdoc researcher at the GRASP Lab and the PRECISE Lab with Professor George J. Pappas and Professor Daniel D. Lee, Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. I got my Ph.D. degree, and the "Charles Hallac and Sarah Keil Wolf Award for Best Doctoral Dissertation" in Electrical and Systems Engineering in 2016, with a dual Master degree of Statistics from Wharton School, from the University of Pennsylvania. I got my bachelor's degree of Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2010 with a major in Automation and a minor in Finance.

Research Interests

The broad agenda of my work is to develop the foundations for the science of Embodied AI, to assure safety, efficiency, robustness and security of the systems by integrating learning, optimization, and control. My research interests span several technical fields, including multi-agent reinforcement learning, robust optimization, uncertainty quantification, control theory, and game theory. Application areas include connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), intelligent transportation systems and transportation decarbonization, smart cities, and power networks.




My research experience and current ongoing projects include robust reinforcement learning and control, uncertainty quantification for collaborative perception, game theoretical analysis for the benefit of information sharing for CAVs, data-driven robust optimization for efficient mobile CPS, conflict resolution of smart cities, and resilient control of CPS under attacks. In addition to system modeling, theoretical analysis, and algorithmic design, my work involves experimental validation in real urban transportation data, simulators and small scale autonomous vehicles.
