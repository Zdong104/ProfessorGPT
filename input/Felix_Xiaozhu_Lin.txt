Associate Prof.	William Wulf Faculty Fellow	UVA Computer Science	CV	Contact

PhD (Rice ‘14); MS/BS (‘08/’06 Tsinghua). Grew up in a small midwestern town in China. Before UVA, six great years at Purdue.

Fall 2024: We are recruiting! (Recent projects) algo x sys x hw for:

LLMs: on-device execution, private data selection & training
Speech: execution of deep models on $35 hardware
Stable diffusion: fast sampling on consumer CPU/GPU
Geometric deep learning: 3D vision, graph neural networks, etc.
Various old-fashioned, hardcore OS stuffs (see pubs below)

I led a group of graduate/undergraduate students who are execited by building cool software stuffs.

See our group page for current students and projects.

Efforts on refreshing OS education (UVA CS4414/CS6456). Principles: experience-based, with modern contents, and fun. Summary: four projects including an Arm64 baremetal kernel, multicore, trusted execution, and filesystem forensics.

The first offering in Fall’20 as CS6456. Well received! Materials; student feedbacks; schedule

Research (Publications)

I care about systems software. I work with a group of students with enthusiasm in systems software. See XSEL.

Our current work bases on two premises:

1. Old kernels (e.g. Linux) are firmware
Reuse via Replay: GPU replay [ASPLOS’22, Eurosys’23]; Driverlet [Eurosys’22].
Transkernel: unmodified Linux drivers on microcontroller-like cores (ATC’19 and HotMobile’17).
Overwatch: safeguarding unmodified file systems for IoT devices (preprint)
Power sandbox: power awareness redefined (Eurosys’18).
2. New OSes are defined by scenarios
STI: turbocharged NLP inference [ASPLOS’23]
Elf: autonomous AI cameras (Mobisys’20, 3-min video, website, slides)
VStore: managing large archival videos for analytics (Eurosys’19).
StreamBox: stream analytics with manycores (ATC’17), with 3D-stacked memory (ASPLOS’19), and with Arm TrustZone (ATC’19).

My PhD work was on OS kernels for smartphones, e.g. the K2 project which won an award in ASPLOS’14. I continue to care about mobile/wearables, e.g. deep learning on them (WWW’19 & MobiCom’18).
