Research Interests

Our research is dedicated to enhancing AI safety and ethics by crafting responsible machine learning techniques. We aim to build resilient AI systems capable of identifying and adapting to novel scenarios, quantifying and managing uncertainties for safety applications, and promoting fairness and equity in various domains. Our objective is to reliably detect and address safety concerns, ethical dilemmas, biases, and anomalies within complex datasets. Our work leverages AI to improve healthcare diagnostics, ensure the safety of autonomous systems, uphold fairness in financial services, strengthen cybersecurity, tackle environmental issues, ethically moderate digital content, reform the criminal justice system, and tailor educational experiences, all while prioritizing safety, equity, and tangible benefits for society.

Quote:

"The basic guidelines of an ethical AI system refer to those values which can be implemented at the core of every AI algorithm to bring out the safety, security, and fundamental goodness of artificial intelligence for all beings and human society at large."

Background

I joined the Computer Science Department at UT Dallas as an Associate Professor with tenure in 2019-Fall. I was previously an assistant professor in the Computer Science department at University at Albany - SUNY from 2014-Spring to 2019-Spring. I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Event and Pattern Detection (EPD) Laboratory and the iLab at Carnegie Mellon University in 2013, where I worked with Daniel B. Neill and Ramayya Krishnan . I got my Ph.D. from the Computer Science Depatment at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University under the advising of Chang-Tien Lu in Dec. 2012; M.S. from the School of Computer Science at Beijing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics University in Mar. 2004; and B.S. from the School of Computer and Communication at Hunan University in Jul. 2001. During my doctoral studies, I also worked at IBM T.J. Watson Research Labs, Hawthorne, NY during 2011 summer.
