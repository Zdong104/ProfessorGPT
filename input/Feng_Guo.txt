Research Interests: 
​
My research group aims to develop intelligent biomedical systems at the interface of device engineering, artificial intelligence (AI), and translational medicine.  

Specifically, we are developing:
(1) Intelligent organoid systems for disease modeling, drug screening, and biocomputing;
(2) Intelligent healthcare systems for personalized diagnosis and therapy;
	
 
Microneedle patches to treat bioflim
