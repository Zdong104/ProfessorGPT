Feras Saad

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon, affiliated with the Principles of Programming and Artificial Intelligence groups.

My research explores the design and implementation of principled probabilistic inference systems that operate with a high degree of automation, accuracy, and scale. My interests span multiple levels of the computation stack, including:

statistical inference and data science, e.g., Bayesian methods, nonparametrics;
probabilistic programming languages, e.g., semantics, compilers, program synthesis;
mathematical foundations, e.g., computability and complexity of stochastic simulation.
I also maintain open-source software libraries to help practitioners use these techniques in their own problems. See research and software for an overview.

Background

I received the PhD in Computer Science, and MEng/SB degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, from MIT. My theses on probabilistic programming were recognized with the Sprowls PhD Thesis Award in AI+Decision Making and Johnson MEng Thesis Award in Computer Science.
