Ferdinando Fioretto

Assistant Professor of Computer Science, University of Virginia

307 Rice Hall

85 Engineer's Way

Charlottesville, VA 22904

I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I lead the Responsible AI for Science and Engineering (RAISE) group where we make advances in artificial intelligence with focus on two key themes:
AI for Science and Engineering: We develop the foundations to blend deep learning and constrained optimization for complex scientific and engineering problems.
Trustworthy & Responsible AI: We analyze the equity of AI systems in support of decision-making and learning tasks, focusing especially on privacy and fairness.

I am a recipient of the 2022 AWS Amazon Research Award, the 2022 NSF CAREER award, the 2022 Google Research Scholar Award, the 2022 Caspar Bowden PET award, the 2021 ISSNAF Mario Gerla Young Investigator Award, the 2021 ACP Early Career Researcher Award, the 2017 AI*AI Best AI dissertation award, and several best paper awards. My group is generously supported by various projects from the National Science Foundation, Google, Amazon, and the University of Virginia.
