Hi there!

I'm Frank Ferraro, an associate professor in computer science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). I publish under Francis Ferraro.

My main focus is on developing NLP and machine learning models for improved semantic understanding/representation. I generally refer to this as computational event semantics, focusing on developing systems and models that probe at that deeper understanding. The goal of computational event semantics is to develop models that capture common intuitions and expectations about what happens (or doesn’t) in complex situations and who (what types of participants) may be involved. This grounds my research agenda into two high-level thrusts:

How can one define what an “event” is, and how does that influence inferences that are made at the word, sentence, or document level?
How can we use large-scale event knowledge to extract, represent, or verify information or beliefs?
