Hello world! 

I'm an Assistant Professor in Georgia Tech's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) and School of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE).
I do research on computer security and privacy, particularly focused on Internet, network, and web security and privacy.

I lead the BEES Lab! Check it out to learn more about my group.



FOR PROSPECTIVE Ph.D. STUDENTS: If you are interested in joining my group, please apply through Georgia Tech's Ph.D. programs in SCP, SCS, or ECE. I carefully look through all potential applicants. However, please do not email me, as I receive too many such emails and will not directly reply.
