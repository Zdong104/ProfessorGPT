Description: FREDERIC SALA


Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin CS
fredsala@cs.wisc.edu

I study the fundamentals of data-driven systems and machine learning. I am especially interested in data- and compute-efficient systems.

Much of my current work focuses on foundation models, automated machine learning, and learning with limited data and annotations.

I have a research leadership role at Snorkel AI, where we are building a data-first approach to AI.

Previously, I was a postdoc in Stanford CS, associated with the Hazy group. I completed my Ph.D. in electrical engineering at UCLA, where I worked with the LORIS and StarAI groups.
