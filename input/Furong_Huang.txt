Biography

Dr. Furong Huang is an Assistant Professor of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland. Her research focuses on machine learning, high-dimensional statistics, non-convex optimization, spectral methods, reinforcement learning and deep learning theory.

The thesis of Dr. Huang’s research is to understand the foundations of deep learning under distribution shifts, adversarial perturbations and non-iid data. Through the investigation of principled methods that address the modern challenges in applying ML to real-world application, Dr. Huang’s group expands the scope of deep learning model design for learning in constrained edge clients and on graph data.
