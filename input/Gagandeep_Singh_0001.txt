I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) where I lead the FOrmally Certified Automation and Learning (FOCAL) Lab. I also hold an Affiliated Researcher position with VMware Research. My current focus is on combining ideas from Formal Logic, Machine Learning, and Systems research to construct intelligent compute systems with formal guarantees about their behavior and safety. Our group has received the NSF Career Award, Google Research Scholar Award, and Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship. Some of the topics (in alphabetical order) that we currently work on are

Deep Learning for Systems
Deep Reinforcement Learning
Explainable AI
Federated Learning
Logic-guided Learning
Machine Learning for Wireless
Neural Network Verification
NeuroSymbolic Program Analysis
Out-of-Distribution Generalization
Safety of Large Language Models
Static Analysis of Differentiable Programs

I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich in 2020 working with Prof. Markus Püschel and Prof. Martin Vechev. During my PhD, I designed scalable and precise automated reasoning methods and tools for programs and deep neural networks. I co-received the ACM SIGPLAN Doctoral Dissertation Award given annually to the best dissertations in the area of Programming Languages. Before that, I completed a Masters in Computer Science at ETH in 2014 receiving the ETH Master Medal and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2012 receiving the President of India Gold Medal.

For prospective PhD candidates: Please apply to the UIUC CS graduate program and mention my name. I will get back to you if there is a good match.
