I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am also affiliated with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (by courtesy), Security and Privacy Research at Illinois (SPRAI), Informatics Programs of School of Information Sciences, and Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL). My research aims to make it easier to build explainable and robust data-driven solutions to safeguard Internet systems and augment human’s ability to perform security-related tasks. I am interested in a range of topics in Security and Privacy, Internet Measurement, and Data Mining. My recent projects are focused on the security of social computing systems, cybercrime, adversarial machine learning, and machine learning explanation. I actively publish in conferences such as Usenix Security/CCS/NDSS/Oakland, IMC/WWW, and IMWUT/CHI. I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2018), Amazon Research Award (2021), Google Faculty Research Award (2017), IMWUT Distinguished Paper Award (2019), ACM CCS Outstanding Paper Award (2018), and SIGMETRICS Best Practical Paper Award (2013). I am part of the NSF AI Institute for Agent-based Cyber Threat Intelligence and Operation (ACTION) and the Expedition Project for Learning Directed Operating System (LDOS).

Before joining UIUC, I worked as an Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech from 2016 to 2019. I obtained my Ph.D. from UC Santa Barbara in 2016 under the supervision of Ben Y. Zhao and Heather Zheng. I received my bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in 2010. I spent two summers at Microsoft Research Redmond in 2011 and 2014.
