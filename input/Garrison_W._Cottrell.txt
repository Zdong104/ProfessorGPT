I am a Professor in the Computer Science & Engineering Department at UCSD. This means I can now go barefoot and there is nothing they can do about it! I am a member of the AI Group at UCSD. My research group, Gary's Unbelievable Research Unit, publishes unbelievable research. Our research is strongly interdisciplinary. It concerns using neural networks and other computational models applied to problems in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, engineering and biology. I have had success using them for such disparate tasks as modeling how children acquire words, studying how lobsters chew, and nonlinear data compression. Most recently I have worked on face and object recognition, visual salience and visual attention,  and modeling early visual cortex.
