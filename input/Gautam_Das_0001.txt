Dr. Das is the Associate Dean for Research, College of Engineering, a Distinguished University Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (CARIDA), and Director of the Database Exploration Laboratory (DBXLAB) at UT-Arlington. Prior to joining UTA in 2004, he has held positions at Microsoft Research, Compaq Corporation and the University of Memphis. He graduated with a B.Tech in computer science from IIT Kanpur, India in 1983, and with a Ph.D in computer science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1990. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and a Fellow of the ACM.

His early research interests were in computational geometry and graph theory. His Ph.D dissertation made several significant contributions to important problems in these areas, including the discovery of greedy graph spanners, the discovery of exclusion regions for minimum weight triangulations, and determining the complexity of convex polyhedral separability. In the subsequent decades, his research interests broadened to all aspects of Big Data Exploration, including data management, data analytics, machine learning and data mining. Some highlights of his contributions have been on keyword search and ranking in databases (e.g., the early DBXplorer system), time series mining, approximate query processing, and Deep Web analytics. He is presently working on areas such as machine learning approaches for approximate query processing, and fairness and explainability in data management systems.

Dr. Das has published over 200 papers, many of which have appeared in premier data mining, database and algorithms conferences and journals. His work has received several awards, including the Communications of the ACM Research Highlights in 2021, ACM SIGMOD Research Highlights in 2019, IEEE ICDE 10-Year Influential Paper Award in 2012, ACM SIGKDD Doctoral Dissertation Award (honorable mention) in 2014 for his former student, and numerous other awards. He has presented keynotes and invited lectures, tutorials and courses at various universities, research labs, and conferences. He has been on the Editorial Board of the journals ACM Transactions on Database Systems and IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. He has served in the organization roles of several major conferences, including as General Chair of ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2018.

His research has been supported by grants from National Science Foundation, Army Research Office, Office of Naval Research, Department of Education, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Qatar Foundation, AT&T, Microsoft Research, Nokia Research, Cadence Design Systems and Apollo Data Technologies.
