About

Geoffrey C. Fox received a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Cambridge University, where he was Senior Wrangler. He is now a Professor in the Biocomplexity Institute & Initiative and Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia.  He previously held positions at Caltech, Syracuse University, Florida State University, and Indiana University. after being a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, and Peterhouse College Cambridge. He has supervised the Ph.D. of 75 students. He has an hindex of 85 with over 41,000 citations. He received the High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) Achievement Award and the ACM - IEEE CS Ken Kennedy Award for Foundational contributions to parallel computing in 2019. He is a Fellow of APS (Physics) and ACM (Computing) and works on the interdisciplinary interface between computing and applications. He is currently active in the Industry consortium MLCommons/MLPerf.

Education

Ph.D. University of Cambridge, 1967

In the next 10 years, I think we are in for an incredible revolution in the way science is done. There will be a huge number of new methods for discovery, and I am driven to make and help make these discoveries. I want to make progress with theoretically innovative advanced computing methods.
