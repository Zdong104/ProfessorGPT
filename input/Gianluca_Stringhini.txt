ABOUT ME

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boston University, where I co-direct the Security Lab (SeclaBU). Between 2014 and 2018 I was faculty in the Departments of Computer Science and Security and Crime Science at University College London (UCL). I am affiliated with the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences, the Computer Science Department, the Center for Antiracist Research, and the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Policy & Research at BU.

MY RESEARCH

In my research I apply a data-driven approach to better understand malicious activity on the Internet. Through the collection and analysis of large-scale datasets, I develop novel and robust mitigation techniques to make the Internet a safer place. My research involves a mix of quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, machine learning, crime science, and systems design.

I am the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, the Early Career Excellence in Research Award from the BU College of Engineering, five best/distinguished paper awards (DIMVA 2019, CYBERSAFETY 2019, IMC 2018, eCrime 2017, ACSAC 2010), and eight honorable mentions/impact recognitions (CHI 2024, CSCW 2023, CCS 2022, CHI 2022, CSCW 2021, CSCW 2021, ICWSM 2020, ICWSM 2017).

My research is supported by the NSF and Google.
