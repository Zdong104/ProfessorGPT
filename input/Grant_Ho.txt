Grant’s research studies computer security, with a particular interest in problems at the intersection of data and security. His recent work focuses on improving the security of enterprises, which includes developing new algorithms and systems to thwart attacks (e.g., phishing, ransomware, and data breaches), and conducting large-scale analyses to better understand emerging threats as well as the costs and burdens of deploying security measures.

Prior to joining the University of Chicago, Grant was a CSE Postdoctoral Fellow at UC San Diego and a Visiting Researcher at Corelight. Grant received his PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley and his bachelor’s degree in computer science from Stanford University. His research has been recognized with three distinguished paper awards across the top security conferences, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, a Facebook PhD Fellowship, and the 2017 Internet Defense Prize.
