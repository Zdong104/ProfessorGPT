Friends
Here are links to some of my friends:

My Ph.D. advisor Henry Fuchs has links to several of his computer graphics research projects on his Web page.

I worked with Marc Levoy while I was a postdoc at Stanford. Visit his Web page to find out about his graphics projects ranging from The Flintstones to Michaelangelo.

Andrew Glassner's page contains lots of computer graphics goodies, including information about his new book and links to graphics journal and conference pages.
