Triathlon and Duathlon

I caught the triathlon bug while interning at IBM and Microsoft Research in Bay area in 2012. Since then if I am not working then I am probably practicing for the next year's  (old pictures). 5xIM so far: Woodlands, TX (2013), Lake Tahoe, CA (2014 cancelled -> 2015), Lake Placid, NY (2016), Santa Rosa, CA (2017), Cairns, AUS (2018). Let's do it together! ;)

In 2017 I was representing Team USA in the M30-34 age group at the ITU Standard Distance Duathlon World Championship in Penticton, Canada. In 2019 I was representing Team USA in the M30-34 age group at the ITU Long Distance Triathlon World Championship in Pontevedra, Spain.

Algorithms competitions

I participated in ACM ICPC and TopCoder competitions (as griffon) competing and setting problems in TopCoder Open Algorithms Finals.

After making it to the TopCoder Algorithms Finals 2010 in Las Vegas (Top-24 worldwide individually), I retired from competitive programming to focus on research and triathlon.

Teaching algorithms for high-school students

I was teaching advanced classes in algorithms for high-school students for ~5 years, coaching teams for algorithmic competitions. I participated in preparation of training camps and contests for the Russian Olympiad in Informatics and the International Olympiad in Informatics (both in Russia and in the U.S.).

My proudest accomplishments as a coach are leading my high-school team to a victory in St. Petersburg Olympiad in Informatics in 2008-2009 and the fact that our sloppy coaching didn't stop Team USA from earning a bunch of medals in 2011.

Non-profit in education for high-school students: Homepage, VK group
In 2009 I co-founded a non-profit organization focused on advanced extracurricular education in algorithms for high-school students (5 – 10 grades) in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 2013 it was expanded to Moscow and Yekaterinburg.

In the early days we were supported by ,  and . Donations are welcome!

Software Engineering

In 2007–2008 I was lucky to be a part of the FBReader team. This is an open source free e-Book Reader project.

We developed the first version of FBReader for Android (now > 10M downloads worldwide on Google play).

 
Very nerdy!

There are some things I can't prove but rather just believe in. E.g. this logo I designed and proposed for the CSTheory website.

Education

St. Petersburg Academic University is a unique center for continuous education in physics and engineering, run by Zhores Alferov, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics. In 8 years there I finished high school, B.S. and M.S. (a pilot class in theoretical computer science where I was the first student). I am forever grateful to all my teachers during those happy years!

Here is a recent video (in Russian) about the new bachelors programs at the Academic University.

Diversity Statement
As a member of SIAM I support and follow its statement on inclusiveness: “As a professional society, SIAM is committed to providing an inclusive climate that encourages the open expression and exchange of ideas, that is free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, and that is welcoming and comfortable to all members and to those who participate in its activities. In pursuit of that commitment, SIAM is dedicated to the philosophy of equality of opportunity and treatment for all participants regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, disabilities, veteran status, field of expertise, or any other reason not related to scientific merit. This philosophy extends from SIAM conferences, to its publications, and to its governing structures and bodies. We expect all members of SIAM and participants in SIAM activities to work toward this commitment.”
I strongly support cultural diversity and my co-authors are from 18 countries: Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Greece, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Korea, United Kingdom and United States.
