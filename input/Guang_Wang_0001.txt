    "Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the love for my family, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind."

Guang Wang is an assistant professor of the Department of Computer Science at Florida State University. He was a Connection Science fellow and Postdoctoral Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and obtained his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Rutgers University. Guang is interested in finding meaningful patterns from large-scale data and then designing socially informed decision making algorithms to address real-world societal challenges. Currently, his research is mainly focusing on Cyber-Physical Systems, Spatiotemporal Data Mining, Human-Centered Computing, and Trustworthy Machine Learning (Fairness, Privacy, Transparency), especially for applications on Mobility, Smart&Connected Community, Healthcare, Economy, Climate Change, and Sustainability.

Openings!!! I am always looking for self-motivated PhD/master/undergraduate students to work with me on the exciting area of AI for Sustainability. Please send me a short email with your C.V. and anything you believe relevant!
