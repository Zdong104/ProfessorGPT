About me

Welcome! I am an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.

My research primarily focuses on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, general Monte Carlo methods, and probability. Recently I am also very interested in quantum computing. Feel free to contact me if you would like to chat about interests we may share. My research is partially supported by NSF DMS-2210849 and an Adobe Data Science Research Award . Thank you!

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics (Ph.D. minor in Statistics) from Stanford University in August 2020, advised by Prof. Persi Diaconis. Prior to that, I received my B.S. with Honors in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Jun 2015.

My Erdős number is 2 ( [1] , [2] , and [3]. )
