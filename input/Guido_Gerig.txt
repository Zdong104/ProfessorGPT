Guido Gerig is Institute Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and he is a professor of Biomedical Engineering. He also holds associated/affiliated appointments at NYU Courant CS, NYU Langone Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychiatry and Radiology. He was Department Chair of Tandon CSE department 2016-2021.

Guido Gerig has been awarded the Enduring Impact Award of the MICCAI society (2023), was named IEEE Fellow (class of 2019) and has also been appointed as a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical  and  Biological  Engineering (AIMBE) in 2010.

Starting image analysis with applications to satellite imaging, he became increasingly interested in driving problems from medicine, tackled in close multidisciplinary collaboration between medicine, engineering, and statistics. His research supports a number of clinical imaging research studies with novel, innovative image analysis methodologies related to segmentation, registration, atlas building, shape analysis, and image statistics. Driving clinical problems include research in autism, Down's syncdrome, eye diseases (Glaucoma, AMD), multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, studies of infants at risk for mental illness, and in general analysis of anatomical changes from normal due to disease, therapy and recovery. Gerig's research resulted in various new image analysis methodologies for nonlinear processing, multi-scale segmentation and shape analysis, some of them first and seminal to the field. Applications resulted in new clinical research discoveries such as vulnerability for schizophrenia, early diagnosis of autism based on differences in brain development trajectories, and correlation of shape atrophy with risk status in Huntington's. New tools and methods such as itkSNAP and SlicerSalt are developed as open source software and disseminated to the public, including teaching materials and organization hands-on training workshops.

Guido Gerig was previously USTAR Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah (2007-2015) establishing the Utah Center for Neuroimage Analysis (UCNIA), Taylor Grandy Professor of Computer Science and Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1998-2007) launching the UNC Neuro Image Research and Analysis Laboratories (NIRAL), and Assistant Professor at ETH Zurich (1993-1998). Gerig holds several awards from Utah and UNC for Excellence in Teaching.
