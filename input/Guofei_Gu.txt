I am a professor and holder of the Eppright Professorship in Engineering in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University. Before joining Texas A&M, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the College of Computing, Georgia Tech, in 2008. I am an IEEE Fellow and an ACM Distinguished Member. I'm currently directing the SUCCESS (Secure Communication and Computer Systems) Lab at TAMU.

A short bio is available here. Find out what's  here.

 Research Overview (SUCCESS Lab Page)

I'm interested in all aspects of network and system security. To solve practical security problems, I use networking and system techniques, as well as program analysis, applied cryptography, machine learning, artificial intelligence, probability/statistics, information theory, etc. My current specific research interests include: (see details in relevant publications by topic)
Internet malware detection, defense, and analysis
SPS: Software-defined Programmable Security (SDN, NFV, Cloud, Edge, 5G ...)

Check out the final report from our 2018 NSF Workshop on Programmable System Security in a Software Defined World.
Check our S2OS project website. S2OS is an ongoing large multi-institute project funded by NSF/VMware, in which we aim to build a new Security OS with Software Defined Infrastructure
Other projects: FRESCO, OpenFlowSec.org
Mobile and IoT security
Web and Web3 security
AI security
Intrusion detection, anomaly detection
Research data/tool release
I am maintaining a list of computer security conference ranking and statistic
