Bio

I am currently an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Computer and Information Sciences (CIS) at University of Delaware (UD), where I am leading the Robot Perception and Navigation Group (RPNG), a key part of UD Center for Autonomous and Robotic Systems (CARS). I am also the Principal Scientist at Meituan USA. I was a Postdoctoral Associate (2012-2014) working in Marine Robotics Group of John Leonard at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). Prior to MIT, I was working with Stergios Roumeliotis in Multiple Autonomous Robotic Systems (MARS) Lab at Digital Technology Center (DTC) and Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota (UMN), where I obtained my M.Sc. and Ph.D. in computer science in 2009 and 2012, respectively. Before that, I had been a research assistant for two years in Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I worked with Ahmad Rad, after receiving my B.S. degree in automation (electrical engineering) from University of Science and Technology Beijing.

Research

My research interests focus on state estimation and spatial perception for robotics and XR, including probabilistic sensing, localization, mapping, perception and planning of autonomous ground, aerial and underwater vehicles, as well as mobile devices:

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)

Aided inertial navigation

Visual-inertial navigation system (VINS)

Moving object (target) tracking and prediction

Multi-robot cooperative localization and tracking

Sensor calibration and fusion

3D scene understanding

Spatial intelligence
