@guyvdb

I am a Professor of Computer Science and Samueli Fellow at UCLA, where I direct the Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) lab. My research interests are in Machine Learning (Tractable Deep Generative Models, Statistical Relational Learning, Probabilistic Programming), Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (Probabilistic Inference, Probabilistic Databases), and Artificial Intelligence in general.
