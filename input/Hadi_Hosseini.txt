Hadi Hosseini
I am an Associate Professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University and an Associate Director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Foundations and Engineered Systems (CAFE). I am a member of the Data Science and AI group; I am also affiliated with CS Theory Group and the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Prior to that I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, hosted by Ariel Procaccia. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, advised by Kate Larson and Robin Cohen.
My Research
I usually work on problems related to Artificial Intelligence and Multiagent Systems. More specifically, I am interested in problems at the interface of computer science and economics. I often study different aspects of self-interested players in multiagent systems, and develop algorithms and theoretical techniques to achieve certain computational and game-theoretical properties.
My research is supported by an NSF CAREER Award, an NSF Medium RI Award and an NSF CRII Award. Thank you, NSF!
