You enter a dark forest. Standing in front of you is:

A professor named Hal Daumé III (he/him). He wields appointments in Computer Science where he is a Volpi-Cupal Professor, as well as Language Science at UMD where he leads the TRAILS, the Institute for Trustworthy AI in Law & Society (in Spring 2024 he's teaching a gen-ed course You and I, and Generative AI; past: Trustworthy ML (F23), AI (S23), Human-AI Interaction (F22), Just ML (F21)); he is also a Senior Principal Researcher the machine learning and fairness groups at Microsoft Research NYC. He and his wonderful advisees like to study questions related to how to get machines to becomes more adept at human language (and artificial intelligence tasks more broadly), by developing models and algorithms that allow them to learn from data. (Keywords: natural language processing and machine learning.) The two major questions that really drive their research these days are:

    (1) how can we get computers to learn
        through natural interaction with people/users?

and (2) how can we do this in a way that minimize harms
        in the learned models?

He's discussed interactive learning informally in a Talking Machines Podcast and more technically in recent talks; and has discussed fairness/bias in broad terms in a (now somewhat outdated) blog post. He is the author of the online textbook A Course in Machine Learning, which is fully open source.

Hal is super fortunate to be a member of, and have awesome colleagues in the Computional Linguistics and Information Processing Lab (which he formerly directed), the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, and the Center for Machine Learning. If you want to contact him, email is your best bet; you can also find him on @haldaume3 on Twitter. Or, in person, in his office (IRB 4134).

If you're a prospective grad student or grad applicant, please read his FAQ to answer some common questions. If you're thinking of inviting him for a talk or event, please ensure that the event is organized in an inclusive manner (inclusion rider). More generally, if you are organizing a conference, workshop or other event, you may wish to read the NeurIPS D&I survey results (joint with Katherine Heller), Humberto Corona's collection of resources/advice, or two blog posts on this topic.

I acknowledge that I live and work on the ancestral and unceded lands of the Piscataway People, who were among the first in the Western Hemisphere to encounter European colonists, as well as the lands of the Lenape and Nacotchtank people.
