I am an associate professor at UC Davis studying computer vision and machine learning. Prior to this, I was an associate professor at UMBC and a postdoctoral research associate with Antonio Torralba at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I graduated with a PhD in computer science from the University of California Irvine where I was advised by Deva Ramanan and co-advised by Ramesh Jain. I obtained my M.Sc. in electrical engineering at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran (map).
