About Me

I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, affiliated with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am also an Amazon Visiting Academic at Amazon AI and Search Science. Before joining UIUC, I was a machine learning researcher at D. E. Shaw & Co. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Geoff Gordon. During my Ph.D., I have also been closely working with Ruslan Salakhutdinov. Previously, I obtained my BEng degree from the Computer Science Department at Tsinghua University and MMath from the University of Waterloo.

I have a broad interest in trustworthy machine learning. In particular, I work on transfer learning (domain adaptation/generalization/distributional robustness, multitask/meta-learning), algorithmic fairness, probabilistic circuits, and their applications in natural language, signal processing and quantitative finance. My long-term goal is to build trustworthy ML systems that are efficient, robust, fair, and interpretable.

Prospective students, please read this.
