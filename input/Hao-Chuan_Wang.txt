I am a professor, educator and researcher. My broad area is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a focus on supporting collaboration and social interaction, including but not limited to, computer-mediated communication, human-AI interaction, collaborative knowledge work, hybrid and remote work and wellbeing support.  I conduct HCI research, teach HCI to computer science students, and serve the academic and practitioner communities for over a decade. I’m currently serving the HCI community as the VP Finance of ACM SIGCHI. 

My research has contributed to the design of information systems and software tools for global teams, video and  non-verbal communication, online education, telehealth and caregiving, and group creativity. I also studied extensively how these tools can be shaped to address large-scale societal issues, such as bridging cultural and language gaps between global co-workers, and improving expert-novice knowledge transfer for wellbeing, fairness and sustainability.  

I direct the Collaborative and Social Computing Lab (CSC Lab), mentoring students and researchers to take human-centered approaches in Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction to understand, design and evaluate interactive and collaborative technologies.

Before joining UC Davis in 2018, I was an Associate Professor of the Department of Computer Science and the Institute of Information Systems and Applications, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan (NTHU), and a Principal Investigator with the NTU IoX Center, National Taiwan University. 

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Information Science, Cornell University (2008-2011) with an emphasis on HCI and information systems. Prior to Cornell, I studied and conducted research at several institutes, including the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University (2006-2008), Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica (2004-2006), National Taiwan Normal University (2006), and National Chengchi University (2002-2004).
