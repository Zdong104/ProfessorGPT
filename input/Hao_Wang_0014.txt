About Me
 

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University, where I direct a Machine Learning Lab. Previously I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Dina Katabi and Prof. Tommi Jaakkola. I obtained Ph.D degree in CSE department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My supervisor was Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung. I was a visiting scholar working with Prof. Eric Xing's group in Machine Learning department of Carnegie Mellon University. I am also a Microsoft Fellow and received the Baidu Research Fellowship. Before my Ph.D, I got my BS degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2013 under the supervision of Prof. Wu-Jun Li.

Research Interest
 

My research interest focuses on statistical machine learning and deep learning. Currently, I mainly work on Bayesian deep learning, probabilistic methods, game-theoretic approaches, and their applications in trustworthy & safe AI (interpretability, robustness, alignment, etc.), healthcare, recommender systems, computer vision (including LMM), natural language processing (including LLM), network analysis, and data mining.
