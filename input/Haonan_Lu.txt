Assistant Professor

the University at Buffalo

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at SUNY Buffalo. My main research areas are distributed systems and databases. 

My research focuses on understanding, designing, and implementing distributed systems/databases that have enabled today’s large-scale applications. My research strives to fundamentally understand the boundaries of the design space and create new systems close to the boundaries.  I am honored to closely collaborate with many talented researchers. I am also co-advising a student with Wyatt Lloyd in designing a new architecture for distributed databases. 

I am always looking for motivated students who enjoy research.
