I'm the Fujitsu Professor in the EECS Department at MIT and lead the Networks and Mobile Systems group at CSAIL. My research is in the area of networked computer systems, with current interests in networking, sensing, and perception for a world of mobile, sensor-equipped devices connected to services running in the cloud or the network edge. My past work has contributed to mobile and sensor computing, wireless networks, Internet architecture (congestion control, routing, network security), overlay and P2P networks, and data management (stream processing and secure databases). Short bio.

In August 2021, I received the ACM SIGCOMM award for "lifetime contributions" and was invited to give a keynote at the conference (as is tradition), which is on YouTube. The talk, titled "Mind the App!" was about how applications have inspired several of my research projects on mobile and wireless systems, resilient networks, and congestion control.

My papers and group's software.
My older (pre-1999) older papers and software.

Founder and CTO of Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT). A spin-off from the CarTel project, CMT develops innovative mobile sensing technology and data analytics to improve driving behavior and make roads safer around the world. Its products are used daily by drivers worldwide in popular smartphone applications. In 2013, CMT launched the DriveWell mobile app, providing an accurate, scalable, and customizable telematics solution for automobile insurance providers and their customers. DriveWell not only measures driving behavior, but also helps users become better drivers. It provides a scalable technology for traditional usage-based insurance, but also allows insurers to think in terms of behavior-based models.
