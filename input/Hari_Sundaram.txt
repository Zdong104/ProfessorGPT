Hari Sundaram

I am a Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with affiliate appointments in the Charles H. Sandage Department of Advertising, the Institute for Communication Research and the Center for Social & Behavioral Science. My research is motivated by a simple question:

How can we design computational systems that empower individuals to make better decisions?
The research in his group Crowd Dynamics Lab develops innovative algorithms, builds systems and performs experiments. Their research contributes to Applied Machine Learning (e.g., recommender systems for better choices), Network Science (e.g., how platform rules can induce strategic behavior), Human Computer Interaction (e.g., systems to elicit truthful preferences; understanding fairness and discrimination in online markets) and Mechanism Design (e.g., the design of rules to incentivize pro-social behavior). The research from his group has won awards from the ACM and IEEE societies and the American Academy of Advertising. He is a distinguished member of the ACM, and a senior member of the IEEE.
