I am an Associate Professor in the Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I co-lead the Networked Systems Lab. Previously, I held faculty positions at the University of Michigan and at UC Riverside. I received a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington and a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

My research has received the IRTF’s Applied Networking Research Prize twice and led to award papers at OSDI, NSDI, IMC, and IEEE CNS. I have also received multiple Google Faculty Research awards, a NetApp Faculty Fellowship, a Facebook Faculty Award, and an NSF CAREER award.

At the University of Michigan, I was a recipient of the College of Engineering’s Neil Van Eenam Memorial Undergraduate Teaching Award.
