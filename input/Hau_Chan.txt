Research Areas: AI for Social Good(s), Computational Game Theory, Mechanism Design, Algorithms, Machine Learning

My current research aims to address the modeling and algorithmic aspects of societal problems and social interactions involving strategic multi-agent from AI and Machine Learning (ML) perspectives. 

My main approaches are (1) developing computational models to examine the real-world characteristics and behaviors of various problems and interactions and (2) designing algorithmic techniques to analyze computational models to facilitate decision-making. To address (1) and (2), I often leverage ideas from AI, computational game theory, algorithmic mechanism design, and machine learning. 

Currently, I lead the Computational Decision Science (CDS) Lab. 

Current Research Paradigms: 

Game-theoretic Models for Examining Social Interactions
Mechanism Design for Addressing Societal Problems
Resource Allocation and Optimization for Social Good
Collective Decision Making for Social Domains
Machine Learning for Public Health

I am looking for motivated students to work on research projects in the areas of game theory, mechanism design, or AI for social good(s). If you are interested, please contact me (via customized emails discussing my research/papers that you have read) and apply to the UNL CS graduate program.
