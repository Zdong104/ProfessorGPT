I am looking for motivated PhD students!
Please drop me an email with your CV if you are interested.
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. My research focuses on neurosymbolic programming, which lies at the intersection of automated programming and deep learning and spans over programming languages, formal methods, and machine learning. I investigate program synthesis and formal program reasoning techniques to make machine learning systems more reliable and trustworthy. The long-term research goal is to build intelligent and interpretable AI systems that allow the tight integration of deep learning and symbolic reasoning and that can be certified robust and reliable.

I obtained my Ph.D. from Purdue CS, advised by Suresh Jagannathan.
