Welcome to my webpage! I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) Department of the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz. I hold the Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair of Storage Systems Research and I am the Director of the Center for Research in Storage Systems (CRSS). I am also a member of UCSC's Hardware Systems Collective (HSC).

My general research interests are in computer architecture and systems, whereas my current work focusses on improving the hardware-software interface of general purpose processors for emerging data center workloads. I design new microarchitectural mechanisms for the frontend (branch predictor, BTB, instruction cache), mid end (scheduler), and back end (prefetching, memory hierarchy), leveraging compiler and profile-guided optimization techniques.

I held visting faculty positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge and was a research scientist at Google. Previously, I was Postdoc at Stanford University where I worked with Christos Kozyrakis and David Cheriton. I received my PhD from Mannheim University.

I have open PhD, MS, and Postdoc positions in the area of core microarchitecture. If you are interested, please get in contact with me and reference my name in your statement when applying at UCSC.
