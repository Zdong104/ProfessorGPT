I am an Assistant Professor in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I lead the Human And Robot Partners (HARP) Lab. I’m interested in robotics, human-robot interaction, and assistive technology.

My research focuses on developing intelligent, autonomous robots that help humans on complex tasks like eating a meal or learning a new skill. I apply my background in robotics, computer science, and cognitive psychology to build mathematically rigorous algorithms grounded in human behavior research. These algorithms enable robots to detect, interpret, and respond to human verbal and nonverbal behavior. Applications of my research include robot home assistants, robot tutors, and robotic therapy tools.
