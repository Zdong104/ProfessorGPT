Research

Research Areas : Self-aware & Adaptive Computing, Computer Systems, Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems (UChicago Systems Group)

Research Interests: Modern computer systems have to meet goals in multiple---often competing---dimensions; e.g., high performance and low energy consumption. This creates a great burden on programmers who must be experts in both their application domain and in the myriad system issues that affect goals like power, energy, reliability, performance, and more. To alleviate this burden, I study ways to build self-aware computing systems that understand high-level goals and automatically adapt their behavior to meet those goals optimally. This is interdisciplinary work covering traditional areas, like operating systems and computer architecture, as well as new areas, like control theory and machine learning applied to computer system management and optimization.

Recently, I have turned my focus to using these techniques to control machine learning and AI. In other words, I am now building learning systems which dynamically adapt their internal structure and resource usage to meet accuracy, energy, performance, and (most recently) security goals at inference time.

Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion
One of my goals is to run an equitable research group where people from different backgrounds all feel a sense of belonging.

I pursue such efforts because I believe that they are essential the core mission of advancing computing knowledge. To find the best answers to the hardest problems we need to ensure that the broadest possible pool of people are (1) excited to participate, (2) evaluated without bias, including historical and societal biases, and (3) feel a sense of belonging and community that supports their rigorous work.

Equity efforts recognize that merit is difficult to quantify and must be evaluated and debated by committees of experts (admissions, hiring, and promotion). Because those efforts require human judgement, they are subject to human biases. Equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts do not sacrifice merit, they ensure that the most meritorious individuals are recognized.

Furthermore, such efforts do not stop at getting people in the door. They also include making sure that people from a wide variety of backgrounds have the support and sense of belonging to achieve their best once they are here.

I founded and (currently) chair our department's Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion committee and I co-authored our department's Broadening Participation in Computing plan. The current version of the verified BPC plan can be found here: [UChicago Verified BPC Plan] .

(Note that this rephrases a statement that I co-authored with the Physical Science Division's Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Coordination Team. You can find that version here: [EDICT Statement] .
