Description: HERNISA KACORRI
PROJECTS PUBLICATIONS CV

I am an assistant professor in the College of Information Studies (iSchool) at the University of Maryland. I am also a member of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL).

My research goal is to build technologies that address real-world problems by integrating data-driven methods and human-computer interaction. I am interested in investigating human needs and challenges that may benefit from advancements in artificial intelligence. My focus is both in building new models to address these challenges and in designing evaluation methodologies that assess their impact. Typically my research involves application of machine learning and analytics research to benefit people with disabilities, especially assistive technologies that model human communication and behavior such as sign language avatars and independent mobility for the blind.
