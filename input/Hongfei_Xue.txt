About me

Dr. Hongfei Xue is an Assistant Professor of Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He obtained the Ph.D. degree at the State University of New York at Buffalo jointly supervised by Prof. Lu Su and Prof. Aidong Zhang. Before that, he received his B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

Dr. Xue's research interests lie in the intersection of Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, with an emphasis on building intelligent wireless sensing systems. His research focuses on developing algorithms and systems that can intelligently collect, integrate, analyze, and eventually transform the IoT sensory data into useful knowledge that can draw a better understanding of the social and physical world.
