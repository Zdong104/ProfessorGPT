About me

I am an assistant professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Washington State University (WSU). I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2023, advised by Prof. Lei Ying. My research interests lie in designing scalable, efficient, and practical machine learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees.

To Prospective Students

I have multiple fully-funded Ph.D. openings in my group at WSU.

I am looking for highly motivated students with strong backgrounds in mathematics, reinforcement learning, machine learning, and optimization to work with me.

Moreover, interns and visiting students are highly welcome!

Please shoot me an email if you are interested in working with me. Please include your resume, and undergraduate / graduate transcripts.

Research

My research interests include

Online Learning and Decision-making

Reinforcement Learning and Constrained Reinforcement Learning

Stochastic Modeling, Analysis and Optimization

Reinforcement Learning with Applications in Communication, Ride-hailing, and Social Networks

News!
