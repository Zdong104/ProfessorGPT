Short Bio (CV)


I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University at Buffalo, SUNY. I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2019) and Amazon Research Award (2022). My research spans security, networking, and machine learning. Given the interdisciplinary nature of my work, I have published across a wide range of well-recognized conferences, including security (S&P, CCS, USENIX Security, and NDSS), networking (SIGCOMM and NSDI), machine learning (NeurIPS, ICML, and EMNLP), and human-computer interaction (CHI and CSCW). My research has been funded by NSF (SaTC, CNS, IIS, OAC, SOC, etc.), NSA, USDOT, VMware, Amazon, Google, Dell, etc. I am the recipient of ACM SACMAT Test-of-Time Award in 2024, and the Best Paper Awards from ACM ASIACCS (2022), ACSAC (2020), IEEE ICC (2020), ACM SIGCSE (2018), and ACM CODASPY (2014). My research has won the First Place Award in ACM SIGCOMM 2018 SRC. My research has also been featured by the IEEE Special Technical Community on Social Networking and received wide press coverage including ACM TechNews, InformationWeek, Slashdot, NetworkWorld, etc.
