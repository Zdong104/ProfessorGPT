Biography

Hongyang Ryan Zhang is an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University. He received a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2019 and a B.E. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2012, both in computer science. His research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, algorithms, and statistics. Some of his recent work has focused on developing the foundation of modern machine learning techniques such as neural networks, data augmentation, multi-task, and transfer learning. He is a co-recipient of the best paper award at COLT 2018 for the work on implicit regularization.
