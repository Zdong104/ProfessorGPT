About Me

Hua Wei (him/his) is an assistant professor at the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI) in Arizona State University (ASU). He also affiliates with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Before joining ASU, he worked as an Assistant Professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology and a Staff Researcher at Tencent AI Lab. He got his PhD from Pennsylvania State University in 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Zhenhui (Jessie) Li. Before that, he received his master and bachelor degree from Beihang University (BUAA) majoring in Computer Science, working with Prof. Jinpeng Huai and Dr. Tianyu Wo.




I have several positions available for research interns (flexible time) and several fully-funded PhD positions (Spring and Fall 2025) available. If you are interested in working with me, please read this.

Research Interests

Reinforcement Learning, Data Mining, Urban Computing, Human-in-the-loop Computations
