Research / Teaching / Service / CV / Google scholar

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University. I was an associate research scholar in the department of computer science at Princeton University from 2019 to 2021. Prior to Princeton, I was a postdoc in the Theory of Computation group at Harvard University hosted by Jelani Nelson and Madhu Sudan. I did my PhD at Stanford University, where I was fortunate to have Ryan Williams and Omer Reingold as my advisers. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from Yao Class at Tsinghua University. My main research interests include data structures and streaming algorithms, and I am also interested in other directions in theory, including communication complexity and graph algorithms.
