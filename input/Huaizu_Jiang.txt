About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. I have broad research interests in computer vision, computational photography, natural language processing, and machine learning. My long-term research aims to teach machines to develop visual intelligence in a manner analogous to humans. In the short term, my research goal is to create smart visual perception tools to improve people’s life experiences of using cameras.

Prior to joining Northeastern University, I was a Postdoc Researcher at Caltech and a Visiting Researcher at NVIDIA working with Prof. Anima Anandkumar. I obtained my Ph.D. from UMass Amherst, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. Erik Learned-Miller. When pursuing my Ph.D., I did joyful internships at NVIDIA Research and Facebook AI Research (FAIR). I got my M.E. and B.E. degrees from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

Hiring

I am looking for highly motivated students to join my lab. Check out opportunities for more details.
