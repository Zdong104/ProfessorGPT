Research Interests                                    New Surveys: 1. Causal Inference for Time Series Analysis: Problems, Methods, and Evaluation, 2. Socially Responsible AI Algorithms: Issues, Purposes, and Challenges 2021, 3. Causal Interpretability for Machine Learning - Problems, Methods and Evaluation 2020, 4. Learning Causality with Data: Problems and Methods 2020, 5. Privacy in Social Media: Identification, Mitigation and Applications, 2020; Frontiers in Big Data, Data Mining & Management

His research focuses on developing computational methods for data mining, machine learning, and social computing, and designing efficient algorithms to enable effective problem solving ranging from basic research, text/Web mining, bioinformatics, image mining, to real-world applications. His work includes (i) dealing with high dimensional data via feature selection and feature discretization; (ii) social media mining/social computing, identifying the influentials in the blogosphere, group profiling and interaction; (iii) integrating multiple data sources to overcome ambiguity and uncertainty, (iv) employing domain knowledge for effective mining and information integration,  and (v) assisting human experts by developing effective methods of ensemble learning, and active learning with hierarchical classification, subspace clustering, and meta data. Detailed information can be obtained via his publications and professional activities.
