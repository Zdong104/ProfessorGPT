ABOUT ME

Short Bio. I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science with a joint appointment in the School of Data Science and Society, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at IRIS Lab, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University hosted by Chelsea Finn. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2021 at Pennsylvania State University under the advisory of Zhenhui (Jessie) Li. During my Ph.D. study, I also spent time visiting SAILING Lab at CMU hosted by Eric P. Xing.

Research Interests. My research focuses on both the theoretical and applied aspects of building reliable and responsible foundation models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, Diffusion Models). Additionally, I am keen on utilizing these models to facilitate diverse scientific and social applications, including healthcare, drug discovery, genomics, transportation, and ecology. Currently, my primary endeavors revolve around the following key directions:

Developing automated mechanisms to monitor, detect, and interpret potential failures within foundation models (e.g., hallucination, bias).
Exploring efficient strategies to equip AI models with the capability to characterize, alleviate, and adapt to reliability challenges.
Steering AI models towards better alignment with human objectives, preferences, and ethical values.

Related techniques: Out-of-distribution detection and generalization, hallucination detection and mitigation, preference learning (e.g., RLHF), fairness, model debiasing, uncertainty estimation and calibration, meta-learning, continual learning, interpretability.
