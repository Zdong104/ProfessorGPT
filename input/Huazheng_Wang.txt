About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Oregon State University. I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University from 2021 to 2022, hosted by Dr. Mengdi Wang. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Virginia in 2021, supervised by Dr. Hongning Wang. I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China in 2015. My research interests include reinforcement learning, information retrieval and machine learning in general. Currently I focus on multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning with application to online recommendation and other information retrieval problems.

Updates: I am looking for self-motivated PhD students with solid math and coding backgrounds starting Fall 2024. More information can be found here for prospective students.
