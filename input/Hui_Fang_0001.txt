Short Biography

I am a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Delaware. I am also affiliated with the Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Institute for Financial Services Analytics and Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

I lead the InfoLab group working on exciting topics related to information management such as Information Retrieval, Knowledge base, Data Mining and Biomedical Informatics. My research has been supported by National Science Foundation, University of Delaware Research Foundation and companies such as HP Labs and JPMorgan Chase.

I received my M.S. and Ph.D degree from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2001.

Research interests: Information Retrieval, Enterprise Information Management, Biomedical Informatics, Data Mining

I have a broad interest in all kinds of real world applications that are related to effectively and efficiently managing large amount of text information. My primary research interest is information retrieval. I am also interested in enterprise information management, biomedical informatics and data mining.

One of my main research interests is axiomatic approaches to IR. Here is a link that summarizes useful information about this research topic.

We have developed an online system, Virtual IR Lab, which makes it easier to implement retrieval functions and analyze their results. You are welcome to check it out! (Please use guest and guest for login). If you are interested in using the system a course assignment, please feel free to contact me (hfang AT udel.edu).
