Research Interests:

I work in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and AI Systems & Applications. I am broadly interested in basic research and interdisciplinary collaborations motivated by important applications, with current focuses on Creative, Efficient, and Responsible Multimodal AI to Understand, Emulate, and Interact with the visual world we live in. 

I care about both the basic aspect (fundamental, curiosity, simplicity) and the application aspect (effective, useful/fun, impactful).  I've recently worked on:

Computer Vision: accurate & efficient visual recognition, super-resolution & enhancement, inpainting & editing, vision-language, multimodal understanding & generation, etc.

Machine Learning: transformers, data & compute efficient deep learning, transfer learning, interpretability, generative models, etc.

Creative & Responsible AI: Systems & Applications for Art, Agriculture, Education, Engineering, Medicine, Finance, Science, Transportation, etc.

Besides my university labs, I am also leading a team of over 100 talented AI scientists, engineers and creatives globally distributed across US, Europe and Asia at Picsart (a largest computer vision platform, top 20 most downloaded app in the world in 2020~2022 with 150 million monthly active users and a 🦄️). We innovate on the forefront of AI research, engineering and product for creative communication to empower the creator in everyone of us. Many of our research, technology and products are being used by millions of people everyday across the globe through the Picsart app, website and APIs, try them if you haven't already :-)
