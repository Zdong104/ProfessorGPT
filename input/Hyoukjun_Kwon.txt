I am an assistant professor in the EECS department at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). Before I join UCI, I was a research scientist at Reality Labs, Meta (Facebook).

I have worked on deep learning accelerators with flexible dataflow and mappings based on data- and communication-centric approaches. I was the main developer of MAERI, a flexible DNN accelerator, and MAESTRO , an analytical performance/cost model of DNN accelerators. My thesis was recognized at 2021 ACM SIGARCH/IEEE CS TCCA Outstanding Dissertation Award with an Honorable Mention.

My latest CV is available via this link: CV.
