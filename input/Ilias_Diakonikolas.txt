Description: Ilias Diakonikolas
		I am the Sheldon B. Lubar professor in the CS department at UW Madison, where I am a member of the theory of computing group, machine learning@uw-madison, and the Institute for Foundations of Data Science. I am also affiliated with the department of Statistics, the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, and the Data Science Institute.

Prior to joining UW, I was Andrew and Erna Viterbi Early Career Chair in Computer Science at USC, and a faculty member at the University of Edinburgh. Prior to that, I spent two years at UC Berkeley as the Simons Postdoctoral Fellow in Theoretical Computer Science. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Columbia University, advised by Mihalis Yannakakis. I did my undergraduate studies in Greece, at the National Technical University of Athens.

Research: My research interests are in algorithms and machine learning. A major goal of my work is to understand the tradeoff between statistical efficiency, computational efficiency, and robustness for fundamental problems in statistics and machine learning. Areas of current focus include high-dimensional robust statistics, information-computation tradeoffs, foundations of deep learning, nonparametric estimation, distribution testing, and data-driven algorithm design. I also have strong interests in applied probability, algorithmic game theory, and their connections to machine learning.

Funding: My research has been supported by an NSF CAREER Award, an NSF Medium Award, an NSF AITF Award, a DARPA grant, an H. I. Romnes Faculty Fellowship, a Sloan Research Fellowship, a Google Faculty Research Award, a Marie Curie Career Integration Grant, and an EPSRC grant.

A short professional biography can be found here.
