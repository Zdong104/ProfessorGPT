I am an Associate Professor and Associate Chair for Graduate Studies and Research in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences with a joint appointment in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Delaware. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel) under supervision of Achi Brandt and Dorit Ron. In Fall 2012, I joined the School of Computing at Clemson University. I was also a Faculty Scholar of the Clemson University School of Health Research. Before that I was at the Division of Mathematics and Computer Science at Argonne National Laboratory. My undegraduate school is Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel).




I am co-chairing the Quantum Algorithms technical papers track in IEEE Quantum Computing and Engineering 2024. Please submit your papers!




For students and applicants: I am always actively looking for highly motivated students to work with (both undergraduate and graduate). You are always welcome to stop by my office to chat. Click here to check if I have an immediate M.Sc./Ph.D./Undergraduate/Internship opening.
All applications must be submitted at Academentory.com where my positions are listed with relevant questions. Do not apply via email! Undergraduate students click here.

If you are interested in quantum computing, you may also consider our graduate program in Quantum Science and Engineering that has a special track in quantum computing.
