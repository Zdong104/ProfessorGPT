About

I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Georgia. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2018 at the University of Virginia. My research interests lie in performance and resource management problems in various computing systems (e.g., cloud, HPC, edge, and IoT). Specifically, my current research projects include (but not limited to):

Edge AI: System-level and AI model-level optimization for boosting inference, training, and compression performance at the edge.
Serverless Workflow Management: Cost-performance optimization in collaborative edge and cloud environments.
Reproducible Benchmarking and Measurement: Characterizing various workloads, focusing on performance, reliability, energy consumption, and environmental impact across cloud, HPC, edge, and IoT.

My research is supported by various funding agencies (e.g., NSF, DoD, Army Research Labs, NIFA/USDA) and industry partners.

For more information, please refer to my CV.
