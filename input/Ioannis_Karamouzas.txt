About me

I am an Associate Professor in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Riverside and director of its Motion Planning Lab. I am also an affiliated faculty in UCR's Robotics program and Center for Robotics and Intelligent Systems. My research revolves around robotics, AI, and computer graphics focusing primarily on the development of motion planning algorithms for autonomous agents in both virtual and physical settings. Such algorithms have important real-world applications from designing safer public spaces and immersive virtual worlds to improving autonomous navigation for self-driving cars, household robotics, and automated warehouses.

Before joining UCR, I was an associate professor at Clemson's University School of Computing where I currently hold an adjunct position and worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Minnesota. I received my PhD in computer science from Utrecht University, where I developed motion planning algorithms for crowd simulation purposes working under the supervision of Prof. Mark Overmars and Prof. Frank van der Stappen. I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER award and an Amazon Research award and I have been serving on the editorial board of IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters and Elsevier's Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

Research

My main research interests include motion planning, crowd simulation, character animation, data analysis, and reinforcement learning. I am particularly interested in the development of motion planning algorithms for autonomous robots, physically simulated humans, and crowds of virtual characters.

Teaching
Spring 2023: CPSC 8810 - Motion Planning. After a 2-year of hiatus, I'm excited to be offering again Motion Planning! CECAS grad students from all 3 campuses are welcome to register. We will cover motion planning techniques with applications to robotics and interactive computer graphics. The course will involve programming assignments, guest lectures from experts in the field, and a final project. More to follow.
Fall 2022: CPSC 4040/6040. I am teaching Computer Graphics Images this fall. See the course website for details.
Spring 2021: CPSC 8810 - Deep Reinforcement Learning. This is a newly designed graduate course aimed to expose students to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms and provide them experience with implementing such methods in the contexts of robotics and interactive computer graphics. The course involves synchronous lectures via Zoom.
Fall 2020: CPSC 4420/6420 - Artificial Inteligence. The course will involve both synchronous lectures via Zoom, as well as pre-recorded lectures followed by live Q&A.
Spring 2020: CPSC 8810 - Motion Planning . I am thrilled to be teaching motion planning this semester across three campuses (Clemson, ICAR, CURI-Charleston). This year will have a number of assignments on local collision avoidance, sampling-based planning (PRM, RRT), and RL-based control. See the course website for details.
Fall 2019: Intro to AI, and Computer Graphics Images.
Spring 2019: I'm teaching Motion Planning (CPSC 8810), and Intro to AI (CPSC 4820/6820). CPSC4820/6820 is a new course with the goal of providing an introduction to the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Topics will include: agents, uninformed and informed search techniques, reinforcement learning, perceptrons, and supervised learning. The course is suitable for undergraduate and young graduate students to gain a solid technical background and as a preparation for more advanced work in AI. See the course website for details.
Fall 2018: CPSC 4040/6040. I am teaching Computer Graphics Images this fall. See the course website for details.
Spring 2018: CPSC 8810. I am teaching motion planning this semester. We will cover different techniques with applications to robotics, and interactive computer graphics. The class will involve programming assignments, as well as a final project, either simulation-based or on a Turtlebot. See the course website for details.
Fall 2017: CPSC 4040/6040. The class will focus on the theory and practice behind the generation and manipulation of digital images. Topics include image representation and storage, color systems, affine and general warps, compositing, morphing, and non-photorealistic transformations. See the course website for details.
Spring 2017: CPSC 8050. The class will focus on motion planning techniques for robotics and computer graphics with topics that include A*, dynamic programming, local collision avoidance, kalman filtering, numerical optimization, etc. See the course website and here for more details.
Fall 2016: CPSC 6040 - Computer Graphics Images.
