Description: Ion Stoica's Home Page

I am a Professor of Computer Science Division at University of California, Berkeley, and currently the Director of Sky Computing Lab. I am also a co-founder of Anyscale (2019), Databricks (2013), and Conviva Networks (2006). Here is a short bio.

Research

My area of research is cloud computing, distributed systems, and networking. I am equally interested in designing algorithms and systems with strong theoretical foundations, and in providing practical implementations that are deployable in the real world. A list of my publications are available here.

Some current projects include:
Alpa, an automatic model-parallel training and serving system for large-scale neural networks.
Ray, a low-latency distributed execution framework for machine learning and reinforcement learning applications.
Clipper, a low-latency, high-throughput prediction and model serving system.
Succinct, an efficient storage system that supports sub-string queries on compressed data.
Apache Spark, a cluster computing frameworks to efficiently support interactive, and iterative computations.
Some previous projects:
Apache Mesos, a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across cluster computing frameworks, such as Hadoop, MPI and Hypertable.
Alluxio (formerly known as Tachyon), a an in-memory distributed storage for big data processing.
OCALA, an overlay architecture for deploying legacy applications over new Internet architecture.
Internet Indirection Infrastructure (i3), an network architecture that uses a rendezvous-based communication abstraction to support a wide variety of communication abstractions, including multicast, anycast and mobility.
Chord, and efficient lookup protocol for peer-to-peer networks.
Older projects (during my graduate studies, at CMU):
Dynamic Packet State (DPS), a scalable QoS and resource management architecture for the Internet. The main idea of DPS is to have packets carry per-flow state, instead of maintaining the state at routers. One instantiation of DPS is CSFQ (Core-Stateless Fair Queueing), a protocol that provides fair sharing without requiring routers to maintain any per-flow state.
Hierarchical Fair Service Curve (HFSC), an hierarchical scheduling algorithm that decouples the bandwidth and delay allocations.
