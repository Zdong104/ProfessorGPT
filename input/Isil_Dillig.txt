Biographical Sketch

I am a professor at the computer science department of the University of Texas at Austin where I lead the UToPiA research group. My main research interests are program synthesis and verification. I obtained all my degrees (BS, MS, PhD) at Stanford University. I am a 2015 Sloan Fellow and a recipient of an NSF CAREER award. I am also a co-founder of Veridise, a company that provides security solutions for blockchain applications.



Research

My main research interests are program analysis/verification, program synthesis, and automated logical reasoning. I am interested in developing tools and novel techniques to make software systems more secure and reliable. In particular, my research focuses on automatically proving the absence of certain classes of errors and security vulnerabilities in software. These days, I am particularly interested in techniques for automatically synthesizing programs from formal or informal specifications, such as input-output examples, natural language, or reference implementations. I am also very interested in applications of such techniques in security, data science, and databases.

My current research combines ideas from programming languages, symbolic logic, and machine learning to tackle a variety of interesting problems. If you want to learn more, please check out my publications !

Personal

I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey and moved to the United States to pursue my undergraduate studies at Stanford University after finishing high school at the beautiful Robert College.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, traveling, photography, and scuba diving. I love taking photos, and you can check out some of my photography here.
