Research Interests:

I am now leading Carnegie Mellon’s RoboTutor team competing for the Global Learning XPRIZE, expanding my previous work on Project LISTEN’s Reading Tutor that listens to children read aloud. The Reading Tutor adapts automated speech recognition to analyze oral reading. The Reading Tutor responds with spoken and graphical assistance modeled in part after expert reading teachers, but adapted to the strengths and limitations of the technology. Experimental use of the Reading Tutor in elementary school classrooms improved reading proficiency. My previous work in artificial intelligence included machine learning, automated replay of design plans, and discovery of search heuristics.

RoboTutor offers exciting opportunities for interdisciplinary work in intelligent tutors, educational data mining, graphic design, speech technologies, cognitive and motivational psychology, human-computer interaction, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

Biographical Sketch:

A.B. cum laude in Applied Mathematics (1974), Harvard University

Ph.D. in Computer Science (1981) and NSF Graduate Fellow, Carnegie Mellon University

Dr. Mostow’s research interests in artificial intelligence have included speech, machine learning, and design. After research and faculty positions at Stanford, Information Sciences Institute, and Rutgers, he joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty in 1992 to launch Project LISTEN, which is getting computers to listen to children read aloud, and help them.

Dr. Mostow was Program Co-chair of the Fifteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI98), and has served as an editor of Machine Learning Journal and IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

In 2003, Dr. Mostow was awarded The Allen Newell Medal for Research Excellence.

In 2010, he chaired the 10th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems and was elected President of the International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

Access to all the books in the Library of Congress is of little use if you cannot read. [F. Cairncross, The Death of Distance, p. 253.]

After all my time here, I’ve yet to see any problem, however complicated, which when you looked at it the right way didn’t become still more complicated.
[spoken by Arne Viken, character in Call Me Joe, by Poul Anderson, 1957.]

Claims about amplified responses to new media are often exaggerated.  Our research is a reminder that we can cry when we read, and we can be bored in a virtual world....  Ultimately, it’s the pictures in our heads that matter, not the ones on the screen.  [B. Reeves & C. Nass, The Media Equation:  How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places, p. 252.]

In August, 2012, I bicycled from Pittsburgh to Washington, DC, joining the week-long final segment of Hazon's (www.hazon.org) Cross USA Ride to help raise environmental awareness, have fun, get exercise, and meet other Jewish cyclists.  The money raised from this ride supported Hazon’s year-round work promoting sustainable food and other worthy innovative projects.

Labor Day, 2000:  Jack welcomes Vice President Al Gore to Pittsburgh.
(Photo by Jack’s wife Janet, who snapped it as Mr. Gore raced down the parade route shaking lots of hands, including Jack’s.  We were lucky that the picture came out at all, let alone in focus and with large enough portions of both faces to be recognizable.  At the time, Janet thought she’d only taken a picture of Al Gore’s belly.  But the picture itself is evidence of its authenticity -- any fake picture would look much better!)
