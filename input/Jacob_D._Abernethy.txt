About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research focus is Machine Learning, and I like discovering connections between Optimization, Statistics, and Economics. I finished my PhD at UC Berkeley with Peter Bartlett in 2011, and I was a Simons postdoctoral fellow with Michael Kearns for the following two years.
