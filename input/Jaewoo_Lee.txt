My Profile

I am an associate professor in School of Computing at University of Georgia. Before joining UGA, I was a postdoctoral research associate working in Prof. Daniel Kifer's machine learning lab at PennState university. I received my Ph.D. in computer science in 2014 from Purdue university, where I studied privacy-preserving data analysis techniques under the supervision of Prof. Chris Clifton. Before joining Purdue, I was a member of database group at Yonsei university where I obtained my master and bachelor degrees in Computer Science. During my master study, I did research on developing efficient stream mining algorithms for high-dimensional data streams under the supervision of Prof. Won Suk Lee.

Research

My primary research interests lie in the field of machine learning, numerical optimization, and their interaction with statistical data privacy (such as differential privacy). I work on developing new statistical models and algorithms for performing various machine learning (including deep learning) tasks on sensitive data. The research topics of my interests are listed below, but not limited to:

Machine learning
Numerical optimization
Statistical data privacy
Security analytics
