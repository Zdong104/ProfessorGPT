about me

I am an assistant professor in the MSIS department at Rutgers University. I am affiliated with DIMACS, Applied Probability and Data Analytics Lab, and Theory group. In previous avatars, I have been a researcher at Apple , postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University and Pennsylvania State University, and a Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo.

My research focuses on theoretical computer science (see my Google scholar, dblp, or research page for more details). Of late, I have also developed some interest in mathematical physics and its application in privacy-preserving machine learning. 

In my spare time, I like to sketch (see the hobbies page for some of the old ones).

The best way to reach me is to send an email to jalaj (dot) upadhyay (at) rutgers (dot) edu.
