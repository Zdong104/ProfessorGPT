My research addresses natural language processing (NLP) with a focus on computational semantics and its application to problems in healthcare and education.

I am the co-author with Dan Jurafsky of a popular textbook on NLP: Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics and Speech Recognition, currently being revised for a 3rd edition.

  
Email is the best way to reach me. Note that I am not currently recruiting new PhD students.
