Description: 	James Hays
Associate Professor, School of Interactive Computing, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology


My research interests span computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. I work on problems related to recognition, synthesis, and manipulation. My research often involves finding new data sources to exploit (e.g. geotagged imagery) or creating new data sets where none existed (e.g. sketches or grasps).

Before joining Georgia Tech, I was the Manning Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown University. I was a postdoc at MIT with Antonio Torralba, completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University with Alexei Efros, and received my B.S. from Georgia Tech. I am the recipient of the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, the NSF CAREER award, and the PAMI Mark Everingham Prize. From 2017 to 2022 I was a Principal Scientist at Argo AI researching self-driving vehicle perception. I am currently working with Overland AI on off-road autonomous vehicles.
