Me

I am a visual computing researcher—computer vision, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction. My lab develops techniques for camera-captured media to remove barriers from image and video creation, editing, and interaction. This requires image and scene reconstruction techniques, especially from multi-camera systems, and with applications on 2D, multi-view, and VR/AR displays.
