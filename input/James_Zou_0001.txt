TITLE

Hi! I am an Associate Professor of Biomedical Data Science and, by courtesy, of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I work on making machine learning more reliable, human-compatible and statistically rigorous, and am especially interested in applications in human disease and health. Several of our algorithms are widely used in tech and biotech industries. I received a Ph.D from Harvard in 2014, and was a member of Microsoft Research, a Gates Scholar at Cambridge and a Simons fellow at UC Berkeley. I joined Stanford in 2016 and am excited to be a two-time Chan-Zuckerberg Investigator and the faculty director of the university-wide Stanford Data4Health hub. I'm also a member of the Stanford AI Lab. My research is supported by the Sloan Fellowship, the NSF CAREER Award, and Google, Amazon and Adobe AI awards.
