I am an assistant professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. I was previously an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Prior to starting as faculty, I was fortunate to be hosted by Michael Kearns, Aaron Roth, and Rakesh Vohra as a Warren Center fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I completed my PhD working with Avrim Blum at Carnegie Mellon University. I study the social impact of machine learning and the impact of social behavior on ML's guarantees. How should machine learning be made robust to behavior of the people generating training or test data for it? How should ensure that the models we design do not exacerbate inequalities already present in society?

Service
In 2020, I was an area chair for ICML, on the SPC for EC, ICLR, and COLT. I served as general cochair for FAT* 2019, which took place in Atlanta! In 2019, I served as an SPC member for EC and ICML. For 2018, I was on the PC for EC, ICML, FAT*, WWW, and ALT. In 2017, I was on the PC for EC, ICML, NetEcon, and FAT/ML. I also served on the EC PC in 2016.
Funding
My research is currently supported by: An NSF Career award, "Strategic and Equity Considerations in Machine Learning". The Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning, an NSF-funded AI Center joint between UT Austin, UW, Witchitaw State, and Microsoft Research. The Theory of Computing for Fairness, A Simons collaboration project. Previously, I was fortunate to be supported by the Simons Award for Graduate Students in Theoretical Computer Science (2014-2016), an NSF GFRP fellowship, as well as the Microsoft Research Graduate Women's Scholarship.
