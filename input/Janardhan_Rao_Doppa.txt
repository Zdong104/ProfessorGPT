Research
I like to work on artificial intelligence and machine learning problems motivated from important real-world applications.  A sample of my current and recent research projects include:

AI to Accelerate Science and Engineering
How can we develop AI methods by combining valuable domain knowledge and data to accelerate scientific discovery and engineering design?

We are exploring novel adaptive experiment design algorithms to provide computing and planning support for scientists and engineers in selecting experiments under resource constraints. We have developed novel Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms to optimize combinatorial spaces (see AAAI-2020, AAAI-2021, NeurIPS-2021, AAAI-2022 , and AISTATS-2023 papers); BO for hybrid spaces (ICML-2021 paper); BO for optimizing multiple objectives (see NeurIPS-2019 , AAAI-2020 , and AAAI-2024 papers); BO for multi-fidelity optimization (see AAAI-2020 , NeurIPS-2020 workshop, and JAIR-2021 papers); BO for handling black-box constraints (see NeurIPS-2020 workshop , JAIR-2021 , and CODS-COMAD-2024 papers); and grey-box BO for Auto ML tasks (see AISTATS-2023 paper). See my IJCAI-2021 Early Career Spotlight paper for a short summary of this research.

We are looking at sustainability applications of NPMs such as (gas storage) densifying hydrogen - a clean fuel - for compact storage onboard vehicles; (gas separation) capturing carbon dioxide from flue gas of coalfired power plants; subsequently sequester it to prevent global warming; and (gas sensing) detecting toxic compounds and explosives. See our MSDE-2021 and Digital Discovery-2023 papers for some initial results.
AI for agricultural decision support to improve water management, farm management, and harvest management by overcoming labor shortage. Excited to be part of the newly funded NSF-USDA AI Institute for Agriculture Decision Support and lead the AI Thrust on modeling systems of knowns and unknowns.
Machine Learning meets Computing Systems Design: ML for Systems and Systems for ML
How can we exploit the synergies between machine learning and computing systems to enable the design of high-performance, energy-efficient, and reliable computing systems spanning from edge devices to servers to cloud, which will empower further advances in ML?

Machine learning methodologies for design space exploration and optimization of manycore systems to significantly reduce the overall engineering cost and design time of application-specific hardware. We developed a theory-guided ML framework by combining the domain knowledge from manycore designers and training data from hardware simulations (see IEEE TCAD 2017, IEEE TC 2019, and ACM TECS 2019 papers)
Machine learning for runtime resource management to save power by maintaining performance and temperature constraints in system-on-chips (SoCs) ranging from mobile to large-scale manycore systems.  We developed a theory-guided ML framework by using the learned models of design objectives (e.g., power, performance, and temperature) as a function of the system state to provide strong supervised training data to continuously improve the resource management policy (see IEEE TVLSI 2017, IEEE TVLSI 2019, ACM TODAES 2020 , and DAC-2021 papers)
How can we leverage emerging technologies and machine learning to design high-performance and energy-efficient manycore systems for Big-Data workloads? For example, 3D integration is a breakthrough technology to achieve ``More Moore and More Than Moore,'' and provides numerous benefits (better performance, lower power consumption, and higher bandwidth) by utilizing vertical interconnects and 3D stacking; Processing-in-memory cores enabled by ReRAM will reduce the data movement; and  integrating heterogeneous processing cores of different types and functional granularity allows us to bridge the energy efficiency of application-specific hardware with the programmability of general-purpose processors. See IEEE TCAD 2017 for TSV-based 3D manycore systems; ICCD-2017 for benefits of M3D in homogeneous manycore systems; ACM TODAES 2018 for improved thermal and performance trade-offs in M3D based manycore systems; ACM TODAES 2019 for overcoming the challenges due to electrostatic coupling in M3D based manycore systems;  IEEE TC 2018 for integrating heterogeneous cores including CPUs and GPUs with conflicting QoS requirements on the same 2D SoC; IEEE TC 2019 for benefits of 3D heterogenous manycore systems ACM JETC 2020 for the benefits of partially connected 3D manycore systems using near-field inductive coupling based interconnect; and ACM TODAES 2021 for benefits of M3D based heterogeneous manycore systems including GPU cores.
How can we design and optimize high-performance, energy-efficient, and reliable manycore systems for training a large class of deep neural networks. See ACM JETC 2018 for 3D manycore architecture with ReRAM based processing-in-memory cores,  IEEE TCAD 2021 for training CNNs by synergistically combining the benefits of M3D integration, ReRAM, and GPUs; IEEE TCAD 2021 to improve the 3D ReRAM/GPU architecture by optimising the normalization layers using BO, ACM TECS 2021 for reliable training of CNNs on unreliable ReRAM based manycore accelerators, and DATE-2021, IEEE TVLSI 2021, and ICCAD-2021 papers on processing-in-memory based manycore architectures for high-performance training graph neural networks.
How can we create energy-efficient and secure edge AI? We have developed a general hardware and software co-design framework that is applicable for problems ranging from simple classification to structured output prediction (e.g., 3D object shapes from 2D images in AR/VR applications). See IEEE TCAD 2018, ACM TECS 2019, DAC 2020, ICCAD 2020, and ICCAD 2021 papers for different instantiations. See IEEE TCAD 2020 paper for analyzing and improving the security of Edge AI applications such as smart homes, mobile health, and smart grid.

Structured Prediction: Algorithms and Applications
How can we learn to predict structured outputs (e.g., sequences, trees, and graphs)? Structured prediction tasks arise in a variety of domains including natural language processing (e.g., POS tagging, dependency parsing, coreference resolution) and computer vision (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation).

HC-Search framework (see JAIR-2014 paper) unifies the cost function and control knowledge learning frameworks for structured prediction. The effectiveness of this framework depends on the quality of the search space (the depth at which target outputs can be located). We have designed the limited discrepancy search (LDS) space, which is parameterized by a greedy recurrent classifier or policy, and also its sparse variant to improve efficiency (see JMLR-2014 paper).  We have also designed the randomized segmentation space for computer vision tasks, where we probabilistically sample likely object configurations in the image from a hierarchical segmentation tree (see Michael's CVPR-2015 paper).
Easy-first framework learns to make easy prediction decisions first to constrain the harder decisions akin to constraint satisfaction algorithms. We have developed a principled optimization-based learning approach for easy-first framework (see Jun's AAAI-2015 paper). 
We have solved a variety of structured prediction applications including multi-label prediction (see AAAI-2014 paper); coreference resolution within document (see ChaoMa's EMNLP-2014 paper); joint entity and even coreference across documents (see Jun's AAAI-2015 paper); object detection in challenging biological images, semantic segmentation of images, and monocular depth estimation from images (see Michael's ICCV-2013 workshop paper and CVPR-2015 paper); and activity prediction from sensor data (see Bryan's KDD-2015 paper)
Other researchers' have employed HC-Search to solve various structured prediction applications: dependency parsing (see IJCAI-2016 and ACL-2016 papers); predicting DDoS attacks (see MLJ-2016 paper)
Deep Language Understanding (with Chao Ma, Jun Xie, Shahed Sorower, Walker Orr, Prashanth Mannem, Tom Dietterich, Xiaoli Fern and Prasad Tadepalli)
How can we build intelligent computer systems that can achieve deep language understanding? In the Deep Reading and Learning project, we are trying to learn a high-level representation called event graphs (a form of Abstract Meaning Representation) from raw text. Towards this goal, we are working on several sub-problems: 1) Entity co-reference resolution within a document; 2) Joint entity and event co-reference resolution across documents; 3) Joint models for entity linking and discovery; and 4) Learning general scripts of events. See our AAAI2014 paper on script learning, EMNLP2014 paper on co-reference resolution, and AAAI2015 paper on learning for Easy-first framework. [Funded by DARPA as part of the DEFT program]
Machine Reading (with Shahed Sorower, Mohammad NasrEsfahani, Tom Dietterich, Xiaoli Fern and Prasad Tadepalli)
How can we learn relational world knowledge rules (e.g., Horn clauses) from natural texts to support textual inference? Natural texts are radically incomplete (writers don't mention redundant information) and systematically biased (writers mention exceptions to avoid the readers from making incorrect inferences), which makes the rule learning very hard. We solve this problem by modeling the pragmatic relationship between what rules exist and what things will be mentioned (e.g., Gricean maxims).  We worked with BBN and other researchers from CMU, University of Washington and ISI. See our NIPS2011 and ACML2011 papers for details. [Funded by DARPA as part of the Machine Reading program]
Integrated Learning (with Tom Dietterich and Prasad Tadepalli)
How can we integrate information from multiple sources to learn better ? In the past, we worked on DARPA's Integrated learning project, where the goal was to learn a complex problem solving task from a single demonstration of the expert. We learned the cost function that the expert is minimizing while producing the demonstration by formulating it as an inverse optimization problem. Our component's name was DTLR (Decision Theoretic Learner and Reasoner). We worked with other researchers from Lockheed-Martin, ASU, RPI, UMD, UMASS, UIUC and Georgia Tech. See our TIST2012 paper for details. [Funded by DARPA]

Personal

I'm passionate about cricket. Playing cricket helps me remain sane amidst the hectic research life. I try to play in the nearby cricket leagues during the summers. I played for OSU Cricket club in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Our team Chak De Oregon won the 2009 NWCL cricket championship.  In 2010, I played for Chak De Oregon in NWCL (Div I) and for Portland club in OCL. We won the 2010 OCL T20 championship. In 2011, I played for only Portland club in OCL as part of the budget cut on cricket. After 2011 season I became very busy and could not justify my time spent on cricket, so I stopped playing. I used to maintain my cricket scores here. 

I like to cook, but I don't like to spend too much time on it. So I follow an engineering methodology for cooking, which provides a good trade off between  preparation time and quality of the food! Does this remind you of my research work on trading off computation time and quality of the predictions? :)
