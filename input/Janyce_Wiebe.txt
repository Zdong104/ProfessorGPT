Description: Jan Wiebe
Professor, Department of Computer Science
and Intelligent Systems Program
University of Pittsburgh
Research Interests
My research areas are artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP). My research with students and colleagues has been in discourse processing, pragmatics, and word-sense disambiguation. A major concentration of our research is "subjectivity analysis", recognizing and interpreting expressions of opinions and sentiments in text, to support NLP applications such as question answering, information extraction, text categorization, and summarization.
