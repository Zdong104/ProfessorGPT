Personal

Undergraduates are often curious about their teachers' secret lives. In the name of encouraging curiosity-driven research, here are a few photos:

John saw Mary killed Jason
I, Jay, and Kay
got chocolate?
As the Astonishing Fuzzo
As Prof. Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady (song video, with captions)
As the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz (song video, with captions)
As van Gogh
Bike diving on a hot day
ALS ice bucket challenge on a cold day
With my grad students
My kids Talia and Lev
At the furniture store
Groovin'
Professing (thanks to a student who prompted DALL-E to generate this)
Mug shot
My great-great-grandfather's lack of street smarts
My brain as of 1999 (sagittal, axial) - study carefully and you can skip my course (well, the first half).
My face 10 years later, as drawn by Hongyuan Mei

And some non-photos:

I own The Type/Token Distinction (that's right, I paid actual money for a philosophical idea, in cryptocurrency)
First Workshop on Unnnatural Language Processing (see also related work)
The Grammar and the Sentence (a song about parsing) (see also All Malonely People)
My Favorite Things (happy thoughts during Covid-19) ; Don'cha Go 'Way Mad; Where or When
Read about the threat of NLP and global warming
Why hamantaschen are better than latkes (animated PowerPoint with speaker notes; debate video coming?) (see also related work)
