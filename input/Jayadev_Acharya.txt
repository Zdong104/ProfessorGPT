Jayadev Acharya
Assistant Professor


Cornell University

email: acharya at cornell.edu




I am an assistant professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and a graduate field member in Computer Science, and Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University.

I am a member of the Foundations of Information, Networks, and Decision Systems group (FIND) and the theory group. Check out the FIND seminar series here.

Before joining Cornell, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Theory of Computation Group at MIT, hosted by Piotr Indyk. I obtained my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC San Diego, where I was advised by Alon Orlitsky. Long ago, I got a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from IIT Kharagpur.

My research is supported by an NSF-CAREER award, an NSF-CRII award, an NSF-CIF small award, and a Google Faculty Research Award.
Research Interests

My research interests are broadly at the intersection of information theory, statistical inference, algorithms, and machine learning. I am curious to understand the interplay between various resources such as samples, communication, privacy, memory, and robustness in learning problems. I am also interested in quantum information and machine unlearning.

With C. Canonne, and H. Tyagi, I gave a tutorial at FOCS 2020 and an invited tutorial at COLT 2021. These tutorials are related to my current interest in information-constrained inference.
