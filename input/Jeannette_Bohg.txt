Short Long Speaker
I'm a Professor for Robotics at Stanford University. I'm also directing the Interactive Perception and Robot Learning Lab. In general, my research explores two questions: What are the underlying principles of robust sensorimotor coordination in humans, and how we can implement them on robots? Research on this topic has to necessarily be at the intersection of Robotics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. In my lab, we are specifically interested Robotic Grasping and Manipulation.
