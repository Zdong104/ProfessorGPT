I'm an Associate Professor and Associate Chair of Computer Science at Brown University. My research is in Human-Computer Interaction, where my research is building personalized systems based on user behavior data. These systems are applied to attention, mobile, user experience, and health. I am primarily funded by the NSF, NIH, and ARO, and have received the NSF CAREER award, Facebook Fellowship, and ARO Young Investigator Award.

My Ph.D. is in Information Science from the University of Washington in Seattle, and my masters and undergraduate degrees are in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before joining Brown, I analyzed search behavior at Microsoft Research, Google, Yahoo, and Bing; and co-founded World Blender, a Techstars-backed startup that made geolocation mobile games.

Brown University students interested in joining my group should review our active projects and read about the expectations. Ph.D. applicants please read the Student FAQ.
