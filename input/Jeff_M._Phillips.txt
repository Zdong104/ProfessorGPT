News and notes:

I organized (with Alex Munteanu) the CG-Week (which includes SOCG) Workshop on Geometry and Machine Learning. It took place June 13, 2024 in Athens, Greece. I also co-organized previous iterations in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016.


Tao Yang (joining Amazon) and Benwei Shi (joining Meta) defended their PhDs in late Fall 2023.

I was co-PC Chair for SoCG 2024.

I am spending Fall 23 - Spring 24 on sabbatical in Leipzig, Germany at SCaDS.AI, Uni Leipzig, and MPI for Math in Sciences.

I was promoted to (Full) Professor in Summer 2023.

Prince Osei Aboagye (joining Visa Research) defended his PhD in Summer 2023.

Zhuoyue Zhao (joining U Bufallo as Assistant Prof) and Zhao Chang (joining Xidan University as faculty) both defneded their PhDs in Spring/Summer 2020. Both were coadvised by Feifei Li.

My "Math for Data" book Mathematical Foundation for Data Analysis is published by Springer and also available on Amazon.

I helped form a new university center, the Utah Center for Data Science. It launched in October 2019, and I am the founding director.

I helped create a new undergraduate major, a Bachelors of Science in Data Science. It launched in Fall 2019, and I am the director.

I post and live-stream many videos of my lectures on Youtube. They now appear on the Utah Data Youtube Channel. Older versions are here and here.
