Jelena Diakonikolas

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Sciences and (by courtesy) the Department of Statistics, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am also an affiliate of the Data Science Institute at UW-Madison.

My main research interests are in the area of large-scale optimization. I am also interested in applications of optimization methods, particularly within machine learning.

Prior to joining UW-Madison, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley's Foundations of Data Analysis (FODA) TRIPODS Institute, where I primarily worked with Mike Jordan. In Fall 2018, I was a Microsoft Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, associated with the program on Foundations of Data Science. Prior to starting the postdoctoral position at UC Berkeley, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Computer Science, Boston University, where I worked with Lorenzo Orecchia. I completed my Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, where I was co-advised by Gil Zussman and Cliff Stein.

Some of my publications are under my maiden name -- Marašević.

Prospective students: I am receiving a large volume of email and cannot respond to individual requests. All of the graduate students in the CS program at UW-Madison are admitted by the department, not by individual faculty. Thus, I can only respond to requests from students who are already admitted to UW-Madison.
