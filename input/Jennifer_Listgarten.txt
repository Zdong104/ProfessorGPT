About me

I am a Professor in UC Berkeley's EECS department , Center for Computational Biology, Bioengineering, and a member of the steering committee for the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab. From 2007 to 2017 I was at Microsoft Research, through Cambridge, MA, Los Angeles and Redmond, WA. Before that I did my PhD in the machine learning group at the University of Toronto. (Feel free to use this short bio and picture for announcements.)

My expertise is in machine learning, applied statistics, computational biology. I'm interested in both methods development as well as application of methods to enable new insight into basic biology and medicine. Recently I have also started to work on computational chemistry. A recent print interview focused on my CRISPR work can be found here. If you're interested more generally in how machine learning and biology go together, check out this Talking Machines interview with me instead. Finally, if you want to hear about my random walk in education & career space, take a look at this Berkeley Science Review profile.

Current areas of interest include: computational methods for protein design/optimization/engineering for properties such as expression, flurorescence, binding, stability, etc.; related methods for molecule design and chemical reactions; drug repositioning and discovery; machine learning methods development, and in particular at the intersection of graphical models, neural networks and variational inference, as well as optimizing black box probablistic functions with pathological regions that can't be trusted; genetic association studies with complex, high-dimensional traits such as image volumes over time.

Previous focus areas include: machine learning methods for time series alignment and normalization; LC-MS proteomics; statistical genetics methods to correct for confounding factors in GWAS, epigenome-WAS and eQTL studies; problems in immunoinformatics such as HLA class I epitope prediction and HLA allele imputation. If you're interested in my statistical genetics work (FaST-LMM or EWASher), please go to this landing page.

Industry engagements: I also spend some of my time with companies. At the moment, these:

Dayzero Diagnostics (Scientific Advisory Board).
Deep Apple Therapeutics (Scientific Advisory Board).
Inscripta (Scientific Advisory Board).
Fable Therapeutics (Academic co-founder).

You can find us here.

If you are looking to do your PhD, applications go through academic entities such as EECS the Center for Computational Biology, or the Bioengineering program, for which you should list me as a faculty of interest. For EECS applicants, please choose as your primary area, CS:AI-SCIENCE.
