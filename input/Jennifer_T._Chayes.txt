Description: Jennifer Tour Chayes

Jennifer Tour Chayes is Associate Provost of the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society and Dean of the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is also Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Mathematics, Statistics, and Information. She is deeply committed to increasing racial and gender diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Chayes’ research areas include phase transitions in computer science, structural and dynamical properties of networks including graph algorithms, and applications of machine learning. She is one of the inventors of the field of graphons, which are widely used for the machine learning of large-scale networks. Her prior work in the modeling and analysis of random, dynamically growing graphs, is used to model the internet, the World Wide Web, and social and economic networks. Her more recent work focuses on machine learning, including applications in cancer immunotherapy, ethical decision-making, and climate change. She is the co-author of more than 150 scientific papers and the co-inventor of 30 patents.

Prior to joining UC Berkeley in 2020, Chayes worked at Microsoft Research for 23 years. She was Technical Fellow and Managing Director of Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which she co-founded in 2008, Microsoft Research New York City, which she co-founded in 2012, and Microsoft Research Montreal, which she co-founded in 2017. Chayes developed Microsoft Research laboratories into world-renowned multidisciplinary centers, bringing together computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists, social scientists, and biologists. Chayes co-founded the Theory Group at Microsoft Research and was Research Area Manager for Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science, and Cryptography. Among her contributions to Microsoft technologies are the development of methods to analyze the structure and behavior of various networks, the design of auction algorithms, and the design and analysis of various business models for the online world. Before working at Microsoft, Chayes was Professor of Mathematics at UCLA.

She has received numerous awards for leadership and scientific contributions, including the Anita Borg Institute Women of Vision Leadership Award, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics’ (SIAM) John von Neumann Lecture Award, the Association for Computing Machinery’s (ACM) Distinguished Service Award, and honorary doctorates from Bard College and Leiden University. Chayes is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. She is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Mathematical Society, the Association of Computing Machinery, the Association of Women in Mathematics, and the Fields Institute.

Chayes is a member of numerous advisory boards and steering and oversight committees, including the UC Center for Data-Driven Insights and Innovation, the UC Health Governance Task Force, Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Institute for Data, Systems, and Society and Schwarzman College of Computing, Harvard University’s Institute for Applied and Computational Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Janelia Campus, the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences in Bangalore, India, the Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities in IT, the Systems and Machine Learning conference, the Climate Change AI initiative, and the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Institute for AI and Fundamental Interactions. She is also a member of the selection committee for the VinFuture Prize.

She received a bachelor’s degree in biology and physics from Wesleyan University – graduating first in her class – and earned her Ph.D. in mathematical physics at Princeton. She completed her postdoctoral work in mathematics and physics at Harvard and Cornell.

Chayes is married to Christian Borgs, her primary scientific collaborator and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley.
