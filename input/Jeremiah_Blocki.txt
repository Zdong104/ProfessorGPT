Purdue Bio: Profile

Bio: I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science at Purdue University. Broadly, my research interests include cryptography, data privacy and security. I like to describe myself as a theoretical computer scientist who is interested in applying fundamental ideas from computer science to address practical problems in usable privacy and security. I am especially interested in developing usable and secure authentication protocols for humans. Are there easy ways for humans to create and remember multiple strong passwords? Can we design secure cryptographic protocols that are so simple that can be run by a human? Prior to joining Purdue I completed my PhD on Usable Human Authentication at Carnegie Mellon University where I was fortunate to be advised by Manuel Blum and Anupam Datta. I also spent a year at Microsoft Research New England as a postdoc.
