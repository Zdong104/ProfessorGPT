Research Interests

Jeremias’ research focuses on foundations of machine learning as well as applications to biomedical imaging. He is interested in learning under parsimonious data, robustness and ethical implications of machine learning, as well as on the interpretability and auditing of these models. His work is motivated by applications of diagnostic imaging in radiology, inverse problems, and biomarker discovery in neuroscience and digital pathology.
