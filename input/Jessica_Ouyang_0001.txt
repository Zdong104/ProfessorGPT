About
 

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Univeristy of Texas at Dallas. My research interests are in natural language processing, specifically in the areas of summarization and computational narrative.

I received my PhD from Columbia University in 2019, advised by Professor Kathleen McKeown. My dissertation was about adapting automatic summarization to new sources of information; here is a talk I gave at Johns Hopkins about my dissertation work.

My CV is here.

Prospective/Incoming Students: If you are interested in working with me, I do not accept research students until after they have taken a course with me. The courses I teach are listed below.
