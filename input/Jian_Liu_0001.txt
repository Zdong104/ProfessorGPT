 About

Jian Liu is an Assistant Professor in the Min H. Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He leads Mobile Sensing and Intelligence Security (MoSIS) Lab @ UTK. Before joining UTK, he received his Ph.D. degree from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. His research interests span Robust and Trustworthy AI and ML, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Sensing, Mobile Security, and Smart Healthcare. His research work has been published at top-tier mobile-computing/AI/security/HCI venues (e.g., S&P/Oakland, ACM CCS, ACM MobiCom, ICML, CVPR, AAAI, IJCAI, ECCV, ACM MobiSys, ACM SenSys, ACM UbiComp, and IEEE ICASSP) and has received regular media attention from outlets, such as BBC News, Yahoo News, MIT Technology Review, NBC New York, IEEE Spectrum, WCBS TV, and Voice of America TV, etc. He was recognized as one of the Stanford’s World’s Top 2% Most Cited Scientists. Additionally, he holds seven U.S. patents, two of which have been licensed to industrial companies.
