ðŸŒˆ We are looking for new Postdocs and PhD students (CBD or MLD) to work on Comp Bio + ML.


I am the Ray and Stephanie Lane Professor of Computational Biology in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I also have an Affiliated Faculty appointment in Machine Learning. Our group was established at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in August 2009 and later moved to Carnegie Mellon in January 2016. I have been fortunate to receive several awards, including, among others, being named "Tomorrow's PI" by Genome Technology (2011), a National Science Foundation CAREER award (2011), and a Guggenheim Fellowship (2020). I am an elected Fellow of AIMBE and AAAS.

The primary focus of our ongoing research is the development of machine learning algorithms for the study of the structure and function of the human genome and cellular organization, as well as their implications for evolution, health, and disease. We also explore machine learning methods for the cohesive integration of multimodal biomedical data, as well as methods for enhancing model interpretability and generalizability. Recent interests include nuclear organization, single-cell epigenomics, spatial omics, comparative genomics, and complex molecular interactions.

Our lab is leading a UM1 Center in the NIH 4D Nucleome (4DN) Program [CMU News]. I am also serving as Co-Chair of the Steering Committee of the NIH 4DN Program. In addition, our lab is involved in the NIH SenNet Consortium and the IGVF Consortium.

I am the Program Chair for RECOMB 2024.
