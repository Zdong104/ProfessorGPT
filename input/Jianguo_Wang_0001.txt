Biography

Jianguo Wang is currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University.

Prior to joining Purdue, he worked at Zilliz on Milvus, a purpose-built vector database system. Before that, he worked at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Amazon Aurora, a cloud-native database system. He also interned at Microsoft Research, Oracle, and Samsung on various database systems.

He obtained his PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego, his MPhil degree from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and his Bachelor's degree from Zhengzhou University, China.





Research Interests

Currently, I'm leading a team of students working on Database Systems for the Cloud and Large Language Models, including Disaggregated Databases and Vector Databases.

Disaggregated Database Systems (for the Cloud)

Memory-Disaggregated Databases
Storage-Disaggregated Databases
Disaggregated Databases with Multi-Masters
Distributed Shared-Memory & Shared-Storage Databases
Serverless Databases with Disaggregation
[Papers: Patent'24, SIGMOD'24a, SIGMOD'24b, VLDBJ'24a, VLDB'23, SIGMOD'23, ICDE'23]
[Major Open-source: We built OpenAurora, an open-source version of Amazon Aurora, based on PostgreSQL v13.0. OpenAurora is a cloud-native database prototype optimized for the storage-disaggregated infrastructure. We are currently working on memory disaggregation and multi-masters within OpenAurora. We hope it will be used by the broader database system research community.]
[External Grants: NSF CAREER Award]
Vector Database Systems (for Large Language Models)

Supporting Vector Data Management inside Relational Databases
Multi-Model Vector Databases (Vector + "X") for Advanced RAGs
Cost-Efficient Vector Databases
Auto Tuning in Vector Databases
Beyond Vector Databases: RAGs, DB-LLM Co-Design, Unified DB
[Papers: VLDB'24a, VLDB'24b, SIGMOD'24c, SIGMOD'24d, ICDE'24, VLDBJ'24b, SIGMOD'21, ICDT'19]
