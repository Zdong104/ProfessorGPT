Hi! I am an associate professor in the EECS department at the University of Michigan. Previously, I was a faculty member at the University of California, Riverside. I received my Ph.D. from Princeton University and my B.S. from Columbia University. My hometown is the lovely city of Halifax, Canada.

My research interests include computer and wireless networks, mobile computing, and multimedia systems including mixed reality. I’ve recently been interested in systems support for the metaverse, its security, and mobile generative AI. My projects typically involve some combination of mathematical optimization and systems implementation. I received an NSF CAREER award (2020), Meta Faculty Research award (2021), Best Paper Finalists at ACM SenSys (2019) and IEEE SECON (2020), and a Best Student Paper award at ACM MMSys (2023). See my CV for more details.
