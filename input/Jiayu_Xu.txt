Welcome!
I am an assistant professor in the School of EECS at Oregon State University. Previously I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the cryptography group of Algorand for a year. Even before that, I spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at George Mason University, hosted by S. Dov Gordon and Jonathan Katz.
I received my Ph.D. degree from UC Irvine in 2019, advised by Stanis≈Çaw Jarecki.
My interests lie in cryptography and security. Have a look at my Research page!
