Short bio: I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics & Applied Mathematics in 2011 and M.S. in Computer Science in 2014, both from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2018 from Rutgers University-New Brunswick. I was a visiting scholar at National University of Singapore (2013 - 2014) and at Duke University (Summer 2018).




I am always looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students with research experience in machine learning. Drop me an email with your CV and transcripts if you are interested.

Research (publications, google scholar, dblp)

My research interests lie in both the theoretical aspects and applications of machine learning. I am particularly interested in the following problems and their interplay:

learning in the presence of noise, e.g. label noise, malicious data;

label-efficient learning, e.g. active learning, learning with enriched queries;

data-efficient learning, e.g. high-dimensional statistics, multi-task/meta/transfer learning.
