Vision and Language: Past, Present, and Future
Computer vision and natural language processing are two key branches of artificial intelligence. Since the goal of computer vision has always been automatic extraction, analysis, and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images, it is natural for vision and language to come together to enable high-level computer vision tasks. Conversely, information extracted from images and videos can facilitate natural language processing tasks. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning are facilitating reasoning about images and text in a joint fashion. in this talk, we will review a recently active area of research at the intersection of vision and language, including video-language alignment, image and video captioning, visual question answering, image retrieval using complex text queries, image generation from textual descriptions, language grounding in images and videos, as well as multimodal machine translation and vision-aided grammar induction.
COVID-19: What Social Media and Machine Learning Can Inform Us
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected people's daily lives and caused tremendous economic losses worldwide. However, its influence on public opinions and people's mental health conditions has not received as much attention. In addition, the related literature in these fields has primarily relied on interviews or surveys, largely limited to small-scale observations. In contrast, the rise of social media provides an opportunity to study many aspects of a pandemic at scale and in real-time. Meanwhile, the recent advances in machine learning and data mining allow us to perform automated data processing and analysis. We will introduce several recent studies ranging from 1) characterizing Twitter users and topics regarding the use of controversial terms for COVID-19, 2) understanding how college students respond differently than the general public to the pandemic, 3) monitoring depression trends throughout COVID-19, to 4) studying consumer hoarding behaviors during the pandemic.

Learning with Unpaired Data
Many learning tasks can be summarized as learning a mapping from a structured input to a structured output, such as machine translation, image style transfer, image captioning, and image dehazing. Such mappings are usually learned on paired training data, where an input sample and its corresponding output are both provided. Collecting paired training data often involves expensive human annotation, and the scale of paired training data is therefore often limited. As a result, the generalization ability of models trained on paired data is also limited. One way to mitigate this issue is learning with unpaired data, which is far less expensive to collect. Taking machine translation as an example, the unpaired training data can be collected separately from newspapers in the source language and target language without any annotation. The challenge of unpaired learning turns into how to align the unpaired data. With carefully designed objectives, unpaired learning has achieved remarkable progress on several tasks. This talk will cover the data collection and training methods of several unpaired learning tasks to illustrate the power of learning with unpaired data.

Spear and Shield: War on Misinformation
Social media, including Twitter and Chinese Weibo, has become an important channel of news and public opinion in recent years. For example, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, candidates and their supporters were actively engaged on Twitter to run campaigns and express their opinions. The convenience and openness of social media have also fostered various misinformation, rumors, and fake news, which have become a serious public concern. To increase the credibility of information on social media and prevent the spreading of fake contents, it is crucial to detect misinformation and disinformation automatically. We introduce our work in this area and provide analyses of the impacts of misinformation on major events such as the U.S. presidential election and COVID-19 pandemic.

Jointly Understanding User and Content from Multimodal Social Media Data
Social media has become prevalent in our lives as the main venue for sharing information, recording moments, as well as expressing feelings and creativity. Two of the most important signals in social media data are user profiles and user sentiments, both of which can be inferred from multimodal social media content that users choose to share or respond to. We have been employing a joint modeling and understanding approach to building interpretable user profiles and characterizing nuanced user sentiments for a wide variety of applications including Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook, Pinterest, Youtube, Twitter, and Wechat. In this talk, we will present the framework along with a few case studies to illustrate the power of our approach, as well as its utilities in content creation, promotion, and recommendation.
Computer Vision ++: The Next Step towards Big AI
With the huge successes of deep learning in computer vision, many vision problems are seemingly being solved. Where do we go from here? We will discuss a few directions where computer vision can be either further pushed to deal with data scarcity and data noise, or synergistically integrated with other disciplines such as NLP and data mining, to continue to advance the frontiers of artificial intelligence. 
Harvesting the Healing Power of AI and Big Data
With the recent rapid advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science, a promising domain is healthcare and wellness management. In this talk, we discuss two directions: first, leveraging electronic medical data including unstructured forms and videos to build robust algorithms for disease diagnosis and medical training, and second and more interestingly, utilizing social media data to detect and alter user unhealthy behaviors such as drinking, smoking, drug-use, and eating disorder. It is also intriguing how these two directions can be combined synergistically, and further to implement effective and innovative intervention.
When Computer Vision meets E-Commerce
Two of the top 10 largest companies by market cap in the world, namely Amazon and Alibaba, are e-commerce companies that are enjoying huge success. At the same time, computer vision and artificial intelligence are making strides in both technologies and applications. What power can be unleashed when computer vision meets e-commerce. We will present a few recent advances in user profiling, behavior analytics, product recommendation, as well as deep sales data mining.

Video and Language
Video has become ubiquitous on the Internet, TV, as well as personal devices. Recognition of video content has been a fundamental challenge in computer vision for decades, where previous research predominantly focused on recognizing videos using a predefined yet limited vocabulary. Thanks to the recent development of deep learning techniques, researchers in multiple communities are now striving to bridge videos with natural language in order to move beyond classification to interpretation, which should be regarded as the ultimate goal of video understanding. We will present recent advances in exploring the synergy of video understanding and language processing techniques, including video-language alignment, video captioning, and video emotion analysis.
Computational Inference of Emotion in Images
With the recent successes in using deep learning techniques to solve computer vision problems, the performances of the state of the art algorithms in many areas, especially object recognition, have been dramatically improved. Researchers are now inspired to address yet more challenging problems, such as associating pictures with aesthetics, and have also reported progress. One remaining final frontier in extracting meaning from images is related to the recognition of emotions that images arouse in humans. The key challenges are the loose and highly abstract nature of semantics associated with emotions. We will discuss how to effectively employ a data-intensive approach to emotion recognition in images, as well as multimedia that include both image and text information.
You Are What You Post:  Personal Analytics from Big Social Media Data
From the abundance of personal records, public data, and user-generated social multimedia contents, rich information can be inferred regarding user profile, user interests, user sentiment, user behaviors, user mobility, user lifestyles, as well as user physical and mental health. We will present a few recent advances in this important arena.

2016 Presidential Election: Donald Trump De-mystified
With social media being increasingly utilized to boost political campaigns, Donald Trump looms large in the 2016 US Presidential Election. With the ability to track the Twitter followers of the major candidates in the running, we conduct a series of in-depth, fine-grained, data-driven analyses, including 1) Will Sanders Supporters Jump Ship for Trump? Fine-grained Analysis of Twitter Followers?, 2) Pricing the Woman Card: Gender Politics between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and 3) Voting with Feet: Who are Leaving Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump? These studies represent a new paradigm for studying political campaigns and provide valuable insight at unprecedented scales and in real-time.

Big Data Better Life
We live in the age of big data. The biggest big data is big visual data, which includes images and other associated information. The biggest challenge is to develop effective computational methods for making sense of such massive visual data. Unlike text which is clean, segmented, compact, one dimensional and indexable, visual content is noisy, unsegmented, high entropy and multidimensional. In this talk, we present a few recent advances towards the ultimate goal of using big data, in particular large-scale and rich multi-modality data, to achieve robust intelligence in order to understand and improve life in terms of healthcare, well-being, politics, business, infotainment, and so on.
Vision with A Billion Eyes
A recent trend in computer vision is driven by images and video generated by heterogeneous and multi-perspective visual sensing networks. We present a few examples of research along this line.  First, we will present an interesting framework for event recognition. With GPS information, we obtain satellite images corresponding to picture locations and investigate their novel use to recognize the picture-taking environment. We then combine this inference with classical vision-based event detection methods and demonstrate the synergistic fusion of the two approaches. Second, to determine the viewing direction for geotagged photos, we utilize both Google StreetView and Google Earth satellite images. Third, we explore using phone-captured images for localization as it contains more context information than the embedded sensory GPS coordinates.  We then build applications to enable people to enjoy ubiquitous location-based services (LBS) using their phones. Fourth, we leverage crowd-sourced photos to remove unwanted bystanders from tourist photos taken at popular attractions and measure air pollution in major cities in China.  Furthermore, given a new source of visual data from public webcams deployed in urban environments, we will present some ongoing work on crowd analytics using such data.
Social Multimedia as Sensors
Social multimedia can be exploited as a powerful new way of sensing social behaviors and activities from user-generated social multimedia contents, including building user profiles from a user's personal photo collection, inferring user personality traits from social media language usage, producing popular and diverse tourism routes from crowd-sourced geo-tagged photos, extracting user sentiment from both textual and visual information in social media, monitoring risky behaviors such as teenage drinking and drug abuse, and forecasting election outcome based on image sharing activities and user demographics extracted using computer vision techniques. Finally, we will share thoughts on current challenges and future directions.

Prospective PhD Students

I'm always looking for self-motivated students and usually recruit two new PhD students per year. Applicants are expected to have strong skills in both programming and mathematics, as well as research experience in closely related areas. Grades alone won't cut it. "I worked on a gazillion of projects" (but have no evidence) is a no-no. Research publications in ranked venues of computer vision, machine learning, or data mining is a plus (and the only reason you need to contact me directly). Sorry but generic spams will be ignored.

To apply, check http://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-program.

Visiting Students

I normally have two to three self-funded visiting student positions per year. I do not provide any paid visiting or postdoc positions, and I do not consider any visits shorter than 3 months. It is expected that you have some minimum prior research experience. A recommendation letter via email directly from your research advisor is needed, if you have not personally met me.

Current UR Students

Current UR students (undergraduate or MS) interested in working with me are welcome to stop by my office during my office hours (see the posting outside my office). It is desirable that you have taken a course with me prior to starting any research in my lab. A resume through email in advance is recommended as opposed to a cold knock on the door.

Reference Letter Seekers

You must have your advisor/mentor vouch for you, if you have not personally worked with me. If you intend to work in my lab, producing meaningful or publishable results is the essence for the reference letter as a generic letter stating that you
worked in my lab would not help your graduate school application.

Internship Seekers

In general, we do not host summer interns unless there is a preexisting arrangement, or you have prior research product(s) to validate your seriousness.
 
Why URCS?

The University of Rochester is a private institution that was founded in 1850. It is one of the smallest and most collegiate schools among the nation's top research universities. According to US News and World Report 2019, the University of Rochester's ranking in the Best National Universities is 29th. It is also one of only 25 schools named a "New Ivy" in the 2007 Kaplan/Newsweek "How to Get into College Guide".

The Department of Computer Science at the University of Rochester is a research-oriented department with a distinguished history of contributions in systems, theory, artificial intelligence, and HCI. Historically, a third of its PhD graduates have received tenure-track faculty positions, and its alumni include prominent leaders at major research laboratories such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM.


Research is a Journey not for the Faint-hearted

Do you have what it takes to be a successful PhD student? The initial threshold is 4 out of 7 and I hope you have all 7 at graduation.

Grit 坚毅
Zest 激情
