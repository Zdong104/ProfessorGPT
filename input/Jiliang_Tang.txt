Jiliang Tang
 	

Jiliang Tang is a University Foundation Professor in the computer science and engineering department at Michigan State University. He got one early promotion to associate professor at 2021 and then a promotion to full professor (designated as MSU foundation professor) at 2022. Before that, he was a research scientist in Yahoo Research and got his PhD from Arizona State University in 2015 under Dr. Huan Liu. His research interests include graph machine learning,trustworthy AI and their applications in education and biology. He was the recipient of various awards including 2022 AI's 10 to Watch, 2022 IAPR J. K. AGGARWAL Award, 2022 SIAM/IBM Early Career Research Award, 2021 IEEE ICDM Tao Li Award, 2021 IEEE Big Data Security Junior Research Award, 2020 ACM SIGKDD Rising Star Award, 2020 Distinguished Withrow Research Award, 2019 NSF Career Award, and 8 best paper awards (or runner-ups). His dissertation won the 2015 KDD Best Dissertation runner up and Dean's Dissertation Award. He serves as conference organizers (e.g., KDD, SIGIR, WSDM and SDM) and journal editors (e.g., TKDD, TOIS and TKDE). He has published his research in highly ranked journals and top conference proceedings, which have received tens of thousands of citations with h-index 88 (Google Scholar) and extensive media coverage (Links).

My student Han Xu is on the job market for a tenure-track AP position. Once he joined my group, he convinced me build a new research direction (i.e., Trustworthy AI). Since then, he is co-directing and co-mentoring this direction with me. In addition, he led the effort of the package DeepRobust and co-designed a course of trustworthy AI with me.

My student Harry Shomer is on the job market for a tenure-track AP position. He dedicated himself to link prediction in many aspects from deep understanding and new evaluation to efficient and fair algirithm design; from uni-relational to multi-relational graphs; from computer science to plant science and biology. His research is an outstanding example of reseach with both depth and width.

My student Dr. Jamell Dacon will join Morgan State University (a public historically black research university) as a tenure-track AP. He is the #9 PROFESSOR from my group

My student Dr. Xiaorui Liu got the 1st Runner Up of SIGKDD Dissertation Award
