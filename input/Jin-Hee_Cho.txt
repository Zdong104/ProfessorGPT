Short Biography
Dr. Jin-Hee Cho is an associate professor and a director of Trustworthy Cyberspace Lab (tClab) in the Department of Computer science at Virginia Tech since Aug. 2018. Prior to joining the Virginia Tech, she worked as a computer scientist (DB III for 2010-2015; DB IV for 2016-2018) at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (USARL), Adelphi, Maryland, since July 2010 and was an ORAU/ARL postdoctoral researcher for Jan. 2009 - July 2010. Dr. Cho was on the adjunct faculty at Virginia Tech for 2012-2016 and at The George Washington University for 2014-2016. Dr. Cho's main areas of research interest includes trust management, moving target defense, defensive deception, metrics and measurements, network performance analysis, resource allocation, agent-based modeling, uncertainty reasoning and analysis, decision making under uncertainty, network science, information fusion and credibility, and social network analysis. She received the best paper awards in IEEE TrustCom 2009, BRIMS 2013, IEEE GLOBECOM 2017, 2017 ARL's publication award, and IEEE CogSIMA 2018. She is a winner of the 2015 IEEE Communications Society William R. Bennett Prize in the Field of Communications Networking. In 2016, Dr. Cho was selected for the 2013 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), which is the highest honor bestowed by the US government on outstanding scientists and engineers in the early stages of their independent research careers. She is also a recipient of the Faculty Fellow Award from the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech in 2022. Dr. Jin-Hee Cho received the BA from Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea and MA from Washington University in St. Louis, MO, USA. She also obtained MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Virginia Tech in 2004 and 2008, respectively. She is a senior member of the IEEE and a member of the ACM.
