Brief Bio: Jin-Yi Cai studied at Fudan University (class of 77). He continued his study at Temple University and at Cornell University, where he received his Ph. D. in 1986. He held faculty positions at Yale University (1986-1989), Princeton University (1989-1993), and SUNY Buffalo (1993-2000), rising from Assistant Professor to Full Professor in 1996. He is currently a Professor of Computer Science and Steenbock Professor of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.

He received a Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1990, an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship in Computer Science in 1994, a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 1998, and a Morningside Silver Medal of Mathematics in 2004. He also received the Humboldt Research Award for Senior U.S. Scientists. He has been elected a Fellow of ACM, AAAS, and a foreign member of Academia Europaea. He was awarded the Godel Prize in Theoretical Computer Science and the Fulkerson Prize in Discrete Mathematics.

He is an Editor of Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences (JCSS), member of the Editorial Board of Computational Complexity, an Associate Editor of Journal of Complexity, an Editor of The Chicago Journal of Theoretical Computer Science. He works in computational complexity theory. He has written and published over 100 research papers. A list of publications according to this web site.
