About Me

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer & Data Sciences at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science at University of Virginia (UVA) in 2023 summer, working with Prof. Jundong Li and Prof. Aidong Zhang. I obtained my master's degree and bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

Research Interest: I am broadly interested in machine learning and data mining. My current research mainly focuses on trustworthy AI (generalization, explanation, fairness, robustness, etc.), causal machine learning, graph mining, AI for social good, and recently large language model.

I am actively looking for self-motivated PhD/Master/intern students. Please feel free to send me an email with your CV if you are interested!
