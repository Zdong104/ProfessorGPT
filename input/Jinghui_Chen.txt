About

I am an Assistant Professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) working with Prof. Quanquan Gu in 2021. I received my B.E. in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Science at the University of Science and Technology of China in 2015.

Prospective Students: I’m looking for highly motivated PhD/intern students to join my group. The official PhD application deadline for the Fall 2024 application cycle is Dec 15, 2023 (details). If you’re interested in joining my lab, please fill and see instructions in the following form (feel free to skip optional questions).

Research Interests: My research interests broadly include the theory and applications in different aspects of machine learning, with particular interests on building efficient and trustworthy machine learning models. Recently, we are particularly interested in the following research topics:

Trustworthiness and safety issues in Large Language Models (LLM alignments, LLM robustness, etc.)
Security and privacy issues for other emerging machine learning models (multimodal foundation models, federated learning, diffusion models, etc.)
Efficient optimization strategies for training large scale foundataion models/federated learning (adaptive gradient optimizers, parameter-efficient training, etc.)
