I joined Google as a Senior Research Scientist in May 2018. I no longer take new students or postdocs in Pitt. I look for research interns (in both summers and regular semesters) who are highly motivated and enjoy learning new things. Please drop me a line at jingtaow _at_ google _dot_ com if you are interested in working with me or have good candidates to recommend. Here is a list of students I advised in the past.

Jingtao Wang is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and LRDC at the University of Pittsburgh. He leads the Mobile Interfaces and Pedagogical Systems (MIPS) Research Group. His primary research lies at the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Jingtao's research interests include Mobile Interfaces, Education/Learning Technology, Intelligent User Interfaces, and Interactive Machine Learning. Jingtao received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, Master degree in Computer Engineering, Bachelor degree in E.E. both from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China.
