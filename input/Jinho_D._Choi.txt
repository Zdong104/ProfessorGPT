Director (Founder)

Dr. Jinho Choi is an associate professor of Computer Science, Quantitative Theory and Methods, and Linguistics at Emory University. He received his BA in Computer Science and Mathematics (dual degree) from Coe College in 2002, MS in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2003 (advisor: Mitch Marcus), PhD in Computer Science and Cognitive Science (joint degree) from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2012 (advisor: Martha Palmer), and post-doctoral training at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2014 (advisor: Andrew McCallum). He was a full-time lecturer of Computer Science at the Korea Military Academy from 2004 to 2007 while he served his military duty in South Korea. He is the founder and the director of the Natural Language Processing Research Laboratory at Emory University.

Dr. Choi has been active in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). He has presented many state-of-the-art NLP models that automatically derive various linguistic structures from plain text. These models are publicly available in the NLP Toolkit called ELIT. He has also led the Character Mining project and introduced novel machine comprehension tasks for explicit and implicit understanding in multiparty dialogue. For the application side, Dr. Choi has developed innovative Biomedical NLP models by collaborating with several medical fields such as radiology, neurology, transplant, and nursing. His latest research focuses on building the conversational AI-based chatbot called Emora that aims to be a daily companion of everyone's life. With Emora, Dr. Choi's team won the 1st-place at the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge 3 that came with $500,000 cash award.
