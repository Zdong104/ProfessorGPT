Dr. Xu is currently a professor of  Computer Science and Engineering  at the University at Buffalo,  the State University of  New York. He received his BS and MS degrees in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and his PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 2000.

Dr. Xu works in the fields of Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Machine Learning, Differential Privacy and their applications in several applied domains (such as medicine, biology, and networking). His research is about developing the most efficient geometric algorithms, machine learning techniques, and differentially private methods for a wide range of fundamental problems. In recent years, he has focused on solving high dimensional geometric problems, especially those from machine learning.

Dr. Xu's research has been supported by National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of Health (NIH),  NYSTAR, IBM, and University at Buffalo. He is the recipient of a number of prestigious awards, such as the SUNY Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities (2017), UB Exceptional Scholar: Sustained Achievement Award (2015), UB Excellence in Graduate Mentoring Award (2021), and the NSF CAREER Award (2005).
