I am a Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of California, San Diego. I am affiliated with the Non-Volatile System Laboratory (NVSL), ML Systems Group, and Center for Machine-Integrated Computing and Security (MICS) at UCSD, and Center for Processing with Intelligent Storage and Memory (PRISM). My research spans and stretches the boundary across computer architecture, system software, and machine learning, with an emphasis on memory systems, machine learning and systems codesign, and system support for smart applications.
