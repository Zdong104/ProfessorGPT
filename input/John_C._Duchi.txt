Description: John C. Duchi



A little about me: I am an associate professor of Statistics and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I completed my PhD in computer science at Berkeley in 2014. My research interests are a bit eclectic, and they span computation, statistics, optimization, and machine learning; if you like any of these, we can probably find something interesting to chat about. (Here is a slightly more formal bio, with higher resolution photos, in the third-person.)

Expository writing

Introductory Lectures on Stochastic Convex Optimization, John C. Duchi. Park City Mathematics Institute, Graduate Summer School Lectures, July 2016.
Information Theory and Statistics, John C. Duchi. Lecture Notes for Statistics 311/Electrical Engineering 377, Stanford University. 2015-2019.

Publications: [a list of my publications] in mostly chronological order.

Please note: unfortunately, I am unable to respond to most inquiries regarding openings for graduate and postdoctoral positions in my group. Admissions to Stanford are handled at a department-wide level, not by me individually, so I am unable to comment on your suitability for graduate school or work with me. If you are already a Stanford student or have been admitted to Stanford, feel free to contact me about interests we may share.
