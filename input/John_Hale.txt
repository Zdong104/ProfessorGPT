TU is so confident in its outcomes, they're guaranteed.

The Center for Career Development, aka CaneCareers, provides extensive job preparation for students throughout their academic journeys. TU's new placement guarantee promises that students who follow the program will land an entry-level job in their chosen field or continue their education within six months of graduation or we'll give them a free semester of grad school.

Scholarships and support come from many sources.

Paying for college involves a partnership between our students, their families and the university. Student Financial Services carefully examines each student's unique circumstances and offers the best package of support possible. We are proud to offer a wide range of scholarships and financial aid options to help students on their journeys!

Seeking advice? Need a boost?

Questions, meet answers. Whether it's pairing undergraduates with upperclassmen who can light the way, chatting with approachable professors who are invested in students' academic achievement or matching soon-to-be graduates with connected alumni in their chosen field, TU's extensive mentoring network is there to lend a helping hand.

TU supports the whole student - physically, mentally and emotionally.

Hurricane Health Center treats minor illnesses and injuries in a traditional medical setting, and TU's Counseling and Psychological Services provides resources to assist students as they adjust to college life. Across campus, Collins Fitness Center is a great place to get or stay in shape, and Campus Recreation offers sports and activities to keep students moving!

Discover the world

When students travel the globe to connect with other cultures, expand their minds through classical studies, and discover solutions to complex challenges, they get a sense of their place in time. TU offers a multitude of experiences for students to cultivate their curiosity. From the Honors College and Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge to study abroad to community outreach, we help students realize their dreams.
