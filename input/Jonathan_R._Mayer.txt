Jonathan Mayer

I’m an Associate Professor at Princeton University, with appointments in the Department of Computer Science and the School of Public and International Affairs. I study the intersection of technology and law, with emphasis on national security, criminal procedure, consumer privacy, network management, and online speech.

Before joining the Princeton faculty, I served as the technology advisor to U.S. Senator Kamala Harris and as the Chief Technologist of the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau. I received my Ph.D. from the Stanford University Department of Computer Science and my J.D. from Stanford Law School.

I’m currently on public service leave at the U.S. Department of Justice, as the Chief Science and Technology Advisor and Chief AI Officer.
