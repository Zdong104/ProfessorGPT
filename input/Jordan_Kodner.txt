I am an assistant professor in the Stony Brook University Department of Linguistics, affiliate of the Institute for Advanced Computational Science, and Department of Computer Science and member Natural Language Processing (NLP) group. My primary research revolves around computational approaches to child language acquisition and their broader implications. In particular,

Algorithmic models of grammar acquisition, especially morphology
How those processes drive language variation and change
What insights they provide for low-resource NLP
What they can tell us about the the intersection of (low-resource) NLP and cognitive science

I am writing a book titled Child Language Acquisition in the Past: A Mechanistic View of Language Change for Edinburgh University Press. It investigates the role that child language acquisition plays in language change. The broad goal is to build a general understanding of language change grounded in an understanding of its mechanisms. Enabled by algorithmic modeling and corpus methods, I draw insights from tradtiional historical linguistics, the cognitive science of language acquistion, and findings in variationist sociolinguistics.

My other academic interests, a few of which have intersected my research so far, include (alphabetically): Chinese language varieties, computing history, evolutionary theory, formal language theory, general NLP, human geography, Indo-European historical linguistics, Latin language, paleontology and cladistics, Roman history and culture, Semitic languages, Shona language, Singlish and Singaporean English, software engineering, and writing systems.

In 2020, I received my PhD (my dissertation) from the University of Pennsylvania Department of Linguistics, where I worked with Charles Yang and Mitch Marcus. I received a master's degree from the University of Pennsylania Department of Computer and Information Science in 2018. From 2013 through 2015, I was an Associate Scientist in the Speech, Language, and Multimedia group at Raytheon BBN Technologies where I worked on defense and medical-related projects. I interned with Amazon Alexa AI-Natural Language Understanding in summer 2020.

Current Courses

LIN 335: Computational Linguistics Monday/Wednesday 2:30-3:50pm.

An introduction to computational linguistics for students with previous programming experience. This course explores the models, algorithms, and techniques tht dominate modern-day language technology, and it evaluates them from a linguistically informed perspective. Topics include corpus-based methods, finite-state approaches, machine learning, and model evaluation techniques. Great emphasis is put on discussing the limitations of existing techniques and how they might benefit from linguistic insights. Students will also hone their programming skills and develop familiarity with state-of-the-art software packages for computational linguistics. Formerly offered as LIN 220; not for credit in addition to LIN 220.

Prerequisite: C or better in LIN 120 or CSE 110 or CSE 114 or ISE 108 or MAT 331; or permission of instructor

SBC: STEM+
