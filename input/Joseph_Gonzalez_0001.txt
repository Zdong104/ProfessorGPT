Joseph is a Professor in the EECS department at UC Berkeley, a co-director and founding member of the UC Berkeley Sky Computing Lab, RISE Lab, and a member of the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR Group). His research interests span artificial intelligence and data systems and he has a wide range of projects including:

large language models (LLMs) that interact with external systems (e.g. tool use, RAG, LLM agents, long context windows)
system support for large language model deployment (e.g. inference, serving, RAG, batch)
large model finetuning
machine learning on edge devices
new approaches to cloud computing
accelerated deep learning for high-resolution computer vision
software platforms for autonomous vehicles

In 2020, Joseph launched a new stealth company based on his research to radically simplify the process of deploying advanced analytics and machine learning in modern data driven enterprises. Prior to joining Berkeley, Joseph co-founded Turi Inc. (formerly GraphLab), which was based on his thesis work on the GraphLab and PowerGraph Systems. Turi was eventually acquired by Apple.

News

We release Gorilla Large Language Model ü¶ç LLMs need to interact with the world through APIs, and we teach LLMs to write APIs calls accurately without hallucination.

POET is featured by IEEE Spectrum! The first demonstration on how to train SOTA ML models on smartphones and resource constrained edge devices.
