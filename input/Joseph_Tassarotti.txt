CV (June 2023)

I'm an assistant professor in the CS Department at the Courant Institute of New York University. I'm interested in programming languages and formal verification, particularly for concurrent and randomized programs.

I received my Ph.D. from CMU, where I was advised by Robert Harper. I was then a post-doc in the PDOS group at MIT. Before coming to NYU I was an assistant professor at Boston College for a few years.
