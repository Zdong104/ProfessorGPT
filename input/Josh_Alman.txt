I’m an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Columbia, and a member of the Theory Group. I work on algorithm design and complexity theory, and I especially like using algebraic tools to solve problems throughout computer science.

I was previously a Rabin Postdoc in Theoretical Computer Science at Harvard. Before that, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at MIT, advised by Ryan Williams and Virginia Vassilevska Williams. I spent the first half of grad school at Stanford until I moved to MIT with my advisors.

I am happy to work with some fantastic PhD students at Columbia:

Hengjie Zhang
Kevin Yeo
Hantao Yu
Sayak Chakrabarti
Yunfeng Guan
Tianqi Yang
Yizhi Huang
