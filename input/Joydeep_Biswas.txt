Interests

Robot Perception, Motion Planning, Control Systems, AI, Deployed Robot Systems

My ultimate goal is to have self-sufficient autonomous mobile robots working in human environments, performing tasks accurately and robustly. In support of this goal, I am interested in research in perception, planning, and control applied to autonomous mobile robots. My research in perception involves developing models and representations for a dynamic world, and algorithms to build and perform inference based on such models. My interests in planning include motion planning, multi-robot coordination, and task-based planning in domains including service mobile robots, and robot soccer.

Prospective Students

I am always eager to work with self-motivated students from all levels (PhD, MS, and undergraduate) with overlapping interests, especially if interested in working on actual robots deployed in the real world. For more details, please see the prospective students page.
