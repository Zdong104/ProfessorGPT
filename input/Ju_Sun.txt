Paper release: Thrilled to release our paper DMPlug: A Plug-in Method for Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models on arXiv! Our simply beautiful idea represents a significant departure from the past methods that use pretrained diffusion models to solve inverse problems, and addresses their major drawbacks: struggle to find solutions that are photorealistic, consistent with the measurement, and robust to unknown noise. I call this “diffusion models for inverse problems done right!” (May 27, 2024)
