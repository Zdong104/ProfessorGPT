About me
I am an Assistant Professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Tech. Previously I got:
a Warren Center Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Computer and Information Science at UPenn.
a PhD in Computer Science from the Computing and Mathematical Science Department at Caltech, where I was advised by Adam Wierman and Katrina Ligett. During my PhD:
I participated in the Data Privacy semester at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing in Spring 2019.
I visited Aaron Roth at University of Pennsylvania during Summer 2018.
I visited and interned at Microsoft Research New England in Spring and Summer 2017, where I worked with Yiling Chen, Nicole Immorlica, Brendan Lucier and Vasilis Syrgkanis.
a Master's in Operations Research at Columbia University. During my master's, I also worked with Augustin Chaintreau and Maria Chudnovsky.
Here is a link to my Google Scholar profile.

Joining the lab
I am currently looking for a postdoc to start in Spring or Fall 2025. If you are interested, please apply through one of the following programs: PPFP, ISyE named postdoctoral positions, and ARC

If you are a Ph.D. student interested in working with me, mentioned my name in your application instead of contacting me directly.

Research Interests
My main interests lie at the intersection of Computer Science, Operations Research, and Economics. My primary focus is to study the new algorithmic, economic, and societal challenges posed by the generation of larger and larger amounts of data. In particular, I am interested in the following areas of research, and their intersections:
Pricing and mechanism design for data markets;
Differential Privacy, in particular in the context of data transactions;
Algorithmic Fairness, with long-term and human-in-the-loop considerations;
Game theory and machine learning, e.g. learning from games and strategic classification.
