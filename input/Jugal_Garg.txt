Jugal's research studies algorithms and complexity for some of the most fundamental problems in economics and computation, with a particular focus on allocation problems arising in fair division and general equilibrium theory. Jugal received BTech and PhD in Computer Science from IIT-Bombay. Later, he was a postdoc in Algorithms and Randomness Center at Georgia Tech, and in Algorithms and Complexity group at Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik, Saarbrücken.

Jugal has received several awards for his research, including the NSF CRII Award, the NSF CAREER Award, the Exemplary Theory Paper Award at ACM EC 2020, INFORMS Koopman Prize 2021, and the Dean's Award for Excellence in Research 2022. For his teaching, he has received the James Franklin Sharp Outstanding Teaching Award 2019, ISE Department Head Teaching Award 2023, and have been featured in the List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent multiple times.
