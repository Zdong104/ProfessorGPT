Julia Kempe
Professor
CDS and Courant Institute, NYU

I am a Silver Professor of Computer Science, Mathematics and Data Science at NYU's Center for Data Science and the Courant Institute. Please see my CV for more details.

In 2023-24 I am on research leave at the CSD, ENS, Paris. Consequently I will not be able to advise new students at NYU during that time.

For Prospective Students

Prospective MS Independent Study Students (not for 2023/24): I usually work with students that are known to me through the capstone course or other teaching. That said if you feel there is an exceptional match in research interests (mainly theory of machine learning and its connection to the sciences (especially physics)), please email me. Please do not apply if you want to work on quantum computing.

Prospective PhD Students: Applications for Ph.D. program are reviewed by a center-wide committee and are very competitive. Please apply directly to the PhD Program of the Center for Data Science. Do not forget to mention my name (and of other faculty you'd like to work with) in the application AND in your research statement.
