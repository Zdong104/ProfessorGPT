Juliana Freire is an Institute Professor at the Tandon School of Engineering and  Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Data Science at New York University. She served as the elected chair of the ACM SIGMOD and as a council member of the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), and was the NYU lead investigator for the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment,  a grant awarded jointly to UW, NYU, and UC Berkeley.  She develops methods and systems that enable a wide range of users to obtain trustworthy insights from data. This spans topics in large-scale data analysis and integration, visualization, machine learning, provenance management, and web information discovery, as well as different application areas, including urban analytics, predictive modeling, and computational reproducibility. She is an active member of the database and Web research communities, with over 250 technical papers (including 12 award-winning papers), several open-source systems, and 12 U.S. patents.  According to Google Scholar, her h-index is 65 and her work has received over 18,000 citations. She is an ACM Fellow, a AAAS Fellow, and the recipient of an NSF CAREER, two IBM Faculty awards, and a Google Faculty Research award. She was awarded the ACM SIGMOD Contributions Award in 2020. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, DARPA, Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health, Sloan Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, W. M. Keck Foundation, Google, Amazon, AT&T Research, Microsoft Research, Yahoo! and IBM. She has received M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and a B.S. degree in computer science from the Federal University of Ceara (Brazil).
