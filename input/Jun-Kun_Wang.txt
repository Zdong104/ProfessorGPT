Jun-Kun Wang
 	

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Halicioğlu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. My research is centered around optimization and its connections to statistics, machine learning, and classical mechanics. I like discovering connections between different research areas, e.g., optimization and no-regret learning, optimization and sampling, optimization and Hamiltonian mechanics.

I was a postdoc at Yale University working with Professor Andre Wibisono. I received my CS PhD from Georgia Tech and was very fortunate to be advised by Professor Jacob Abernethy. I hold my M.S. in Communication Engineering and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University.
