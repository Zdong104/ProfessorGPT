I am an Assistant Professor with The Robotics Institute in the School of Computer Science of Carnegie Mellon University. I also hold affiliated faculty appointments in the Computer Science Department and Machine Learning Department. I study computer vision, graphics, computational photography, and generative models.




Prior to joining CMU, I was a Research Scientist at Adobe Research. I did a postdoc at MIT CSAIL, working with William T. Freeman, Josh Tenenbaum, and Antonio Torralba. I obtained my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Alexei A. Efros. I received my B.E. from Tsinghua University, working with Zhuowen Tu, Shi-Min Hu, and Eric Chang.

Generative Intelligence Lab

Our lab studies the collaboration between Human Creators and Generative Models, with the goal of building intelligent machines capable of helping everyone tell their visual stories. We are studying the following questions:

Interaction between creators and generative models: How can we help creators control the model outputs more easily? We develop algorithms and interfaces for controllable visual synthesis (e.g., images, videos, 3D, visual+tactile)
Rewriting and searching generative models: How can creators repurpose existing models for new tasks, concepts, and styles? How could they rewrite the rules of models? Which model shall they use as a starting point?
Co-existence of creators and generative models: How can we allow creators to opt in or out of generative models at any time? If opting in, how do we credit creators for contributing training data?
Synthetic data generation with generative models: How can we use generative models to produce useful data for improving computer vision and robotics systems?

Our lab is part of Carnegie Mellon Graphics Lab and Carnegie Mellon Computer Vision Group.
