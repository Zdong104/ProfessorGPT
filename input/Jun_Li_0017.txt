About Me

I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science, Queens College and Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY). Before joining CUNY, I was an assistant professor at the School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, in 2017, and my B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China, in 2009 and 2012. Merging the gap between theory and practice, my research studies both theoretical and practical challenges of deploying coding techniques in distributed machine learning and distributed storage systems.

Research interests

distributed computing, information theory, machine learning, distributed storage system
