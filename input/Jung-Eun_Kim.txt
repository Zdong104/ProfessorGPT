JUNG-EUN KIM

I am an assistant professor in Computer Science at North Carolina State University. I work on trustworthy, interpretable, and efficient AI/machine learning. I am interested in bias and efficiency issues in deep learning. I also have a background in safety-critical systems. Prior to joining NC State in 2022, I was an assistant professor in EECS at Syracuse University (2021-2022.) Before then, I was an associate research scientist in Computer Science at Yale University. I received my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and my BS and MS degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

Available Positions

I am looking for genuinely motivated PhD students. If you are interested in working with me for a PhD program, please contact me with your CV and mention your research interests and experiences with regard to mine.

 

Research Focus

Somebody said, “If you think you are not biased, you are dangerous.” That is so true and not different for learning models. We understand a neural network model can be biased, and so we and our models would be safe.

In our group, we care about trustworthy, interpretable, efficient, and sustainable AI/deep learning. We fundamentally anatomize neural networks to understand and verify what is invariant in them and what causes biases and failure modes. So, like a heart surgeon, we open the heart of a neural network, look into it, interpret it, and cure it. Once we get all the anatomy of the architectures, we intend to use them efficiently and sustainably in the era of overwhelmingly large models. All of this is our mission, and we are savvy about them.
