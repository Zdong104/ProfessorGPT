About
I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan and a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR).
I'm broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning. My research involves visual reasoning, vision and language, image generation, and 3D reasoning using deep neural networks.
I received my PhD from Stanford University, advised by Fei-Fei Li.
