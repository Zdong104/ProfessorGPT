About Me Teaching Publications Service Open Source Software CV
About Me
I am broadly interested in algorithms and computational complexity, primarily focusing on the following three research goals.
Understanding the power of low-degree polynomials to approximate Boolean functions. Answering these questions has a variety of applications, especially to quantum computing, learning theory, and computational complexity theory.
Designing protocols for proving the correctness of computations (possibly in zero-knowlege), in which the prover and verifier are highly efficient both in theory and in practice.
Developing efficient streaming and sketching algorithms for basic tasks that are often performed on large data sets.

I am an Associate Professor at Georgetown University and a Research Partner at a16z crypto research. Prior to joining Georgetown, I spent two years as a Research Scientist at Yahoo Labs in New York. Before that, I was a Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley. I received my Ph.D. from the Theory of Computation Group at Harvard University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Michael Mitzenmacher, and I graduated from Yale University in 2009 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a second major in Mathematics.

I am currently at a16z crypto research and on leave from Georgetown.

A website describing my project on streaming entropy computation during the 2007 REU at DIMACS. Note that I can no longer maintain the webpage, and the links to code on the site are now broken; however, the code can be accessed here. The site contains implementations of the algorithms described in A Near-Optimal Algorithm for Computing the Entropy of a Stream, by A. Chakrabarti, G. Cormode, and A. McGregor (In ACM Transactions on Algorithms, 6 (2010), no. 3, pg. 1-21). The REU was a terrific experience.
