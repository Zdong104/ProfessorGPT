Investigating how newborn minds learn to perceive and reason about the world

Try our Newborn Embodied Turing Tests!
Broader Impact

We study newborn animals to discover general principles of how brains work. This understanding will illuminate how babies learn about the world and provide benchmarks for building artificial brains that learn like newborn brains.

Our Mission:
Understand the Origins of Intelligence

Develop high-precision methods for studying newborn animals

Use those methods to obtain precise benchmarks of the origins of core cognitive abilities

Use those benchmarks to build autonomous artificial agents (end-to-end computational models) formalizing the learning mechanisms in newborn brains
