Biography
Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh joined the Department of Computer Science as a new faculty in August 2017. He transitioned to his role as an educator after five years of work as a Principal Research Engineer at Toyota Motors North America R&D. At Toyota, he helped bridge the gap between academic research and industrial practice through requirement engineering and testing methods. Before joining Toyota, he was the 2010 Computing Innovation Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania under the mentorship of Rajeev Alur. He got his Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2010, where he was advised by E. Allen Emerson. His current research interests include the application of formal methods to reason about cyber-physical systems, verification and testing of embedded control systems, real-time temporal logics, and analysing time-series data. He is particularly interested in studying cyber-physical systems that use machine learning based components, such as autonomous driving vehicles.
