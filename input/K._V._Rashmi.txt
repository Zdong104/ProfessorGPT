I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am a part of both the Systems group and the Theory group. I lead the CMU TheSys research group, and also a part of the Parallel Data Lab (PDL). Before joining CMU, I did my Ph.D. and postdoctoral studies at UC Berkeley. My research interests broadly lie in computer/networked systems and information/coding theory, and the wide spectrum of intersection between the two areas.

My current focus is on robustness and resource efficiency in data systems spanning across the system stack including storage, communication, and computation. The key thrusts include storage and caching systems, systems for machine learning, and real-time video communication.

The research from my group has been adopted by industry, both in large-scale production systems and in popular open source libraries, has been featured on popular media platforms, and has won multiple best paper awards. Check out our research below!

My CV is available here.

A note to prospective students:
Due to the high volume of emails that I receive from prospective students, unfortunately, I am unable to respond to them. Apologies in advance for this. But, I do catch up with these emails eventually, if there is a good fit and an opening in my group. If you are interested in joining my group as a PhD student, please apply to either CSD or ECE departments at CMU and write my name in your application.
TheSys ("Theory + Systems") Group

Overarching goal: The amount of data stored, communicated, and processed is increasing exponentially, making data systems indispensable to our society. Data systems have grown to a humongous scale where non-ideal conditions such as failures and unavaiblabilities are the norm. Safety-critical applications are increasingly becoming data driven. The frontiers of computing are expanding into operating regimes which are inherently unreliable. Due to these trends, it is imperative to make data systems robust by design, while being resource efficient and performant. The overarching goal of our research is to design and build next-generation data systems that are robust, efficient and performant, spanning across the system stack including storage, computation, and communication.


Approach:
We take a multi-disciplinary approach, spanning computer systems and networking, information and coding theory, and machine learning. We design solutions that are rooted in fundamental theory and enhanced with machine learning, and build systems that employ the resulting solutions to advance the state-of-the-art in data systems. We also collaborate extensively with industry which enables us to (1) base our solutions on data from real-world production systems, and (2) make an impact on real-world practice. Our industry collaborators include Google, Microsoft, NetApp, Facebook, Cisco, Intel and Cloudera.
