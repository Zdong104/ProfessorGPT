 Curriculum Vitae
 Short Bio:

I am an associate professor at UCLA and an Amazon Scholar at Alexa AI. My research interests are twofold:

Trustworthy NLP: we published pioneering works on aligning NLP models with human values focusing on fairness in NLU and generative AI, as well as enhancing their robustness. I orgainze Trustworthy NLP workshops at NAACL/ACL.

Multimodal Foundation Models: we developed VisualBERT, one of the first vision-language models, and SOTA VL models, including GLIP and DesCo, that can recognize objects through langauge descriptions.

Reasoning in NLP: We developed a method enabling LLMs to adhere to specified constraints. Additionally, we study the commonsense, mathematical, and logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

I was selected as a Sloan Fellow (2021), AAAI senior member (2023). Several papers from our team are top-10 cited papers at AI conferences, and some received awards, such as Best Paper in EMNLP (2017), KDD (2010) and Oustanding Paper at ACL (2023). My research is supported by NSF, IARPA, ONR, NIH, and DARPA as well as industrial partners, including Taboola, Amazon, Facebook, CISCO, OptumLabs, and Google.

Join us! We are looking for prospective students and postdocs, please read this.
