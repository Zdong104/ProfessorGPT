More - Not That New News

Kai Shu is a (tenure-track) Gladwin Development Chair Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology since Fall 2020. His research lies in machine learning, data mining, social computing with applications such as disinformation, education, and healthcare. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science at Arizona State University in July 2020, under the supervision of Professor Huan Liu. He is the recipient of 2024 NSF CAREER Award, 2024 IIT College of Computing Dean's Excellence in Research Award, 2023 Microsoft Accelerate Foundation Models Research Award, 2023 DARPA AI Forward Scholarship Award, 2023 AAAI New Faculty Highlights, 2023/2022 Cisco Faculty Research Awards, the finalist of a 2022 Meta Research Award, and 2020 ASU Engineering Dean's Dissertation Award. He interned at Microsoft Research AI, Yahoo Research and HP Labs. His research is generously supported by federal agencies such as NSF, DARPA, IARPA, DHS, and DOE, as well as industrial collaborators such as Cisco, Google, and Microsoft.

**I will be transitioning to Emory University in the Fall of 2024**
I am ACTIVELY looking for Postdocs and multiple self-motivated PhD students to conduct research in the area of data mining, machine learning, social computing, and natural language processing. Interested students please feel free to drop me an email with your CV and transcript (I can not reply to every individual email).
Research Interests 
AI for social good: dis-/misinformation, privacy, security, healthcare.
Trustworthy AI modeling: interpretability, robustness, fairness.
Learning with imperfect data: self-/weakly-supervised learning, meta learning, data augmentation.
Representation learning: text/graph mining, multi-modal learning, adversarial learning.
Large Foundation Models: factuality, reliability, safety.
