About Me

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and the Institute for Systems Research (ISR), at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am also affiliated with the Department of Computer Science (CS), the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS), the Center for Machine Learning, the Maryland Robotics Center (MRC), and the Applied Mathematics & Statistics, and Scientific Computation (AMSC) program. During the deferral time before joining Maryland, I was a postdoctoral scholar affiliated with LIDS and CSAIL at MIT, and a Research Fellow at Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at Berkeley. I finished my Ph.D. from the Department of ECE and CSL at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I also received M.S. in both ECE and Applied Math from UIUC, and B.E. from Tsinghua University. My research interests lie broadly in Control and Decision Theory, Game Theory, Robotics, Reinforcement/Machine Learning, Computation, and their intersections.

Openings

I am actively looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdocs with a strong mathematical and/or programming background. I am also happy to host (remote) undergraduate/graduate visitors. I might be slow in responding to unsolicited emails regarding openings. Nevertheless, if you have a strong background and think your interests are compatible with mine, please do not hesitate to contact me with your CV. Also feel free to contact me if you are already admitted and looking for an advisor, or mention my name in your Ph.D. application (through either ECE or CS or AMSC programs) if you are interested in working with me.
