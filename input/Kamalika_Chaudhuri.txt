Research

My research is on machine learning. I am interested in the foundations of trustworthy machine learning, which includes problems such as learning from sensitive data while preserving privacy, learning under sampling bias, and in the presence of an adversary. I am also broadly interested in a number of topics in learning theory and machine learning. My group now has a Group Blog with guest posts from others at UCSD.

Here is a survey I wrote on machine learning with privacy. Here is an overview I wrote in 2008 about learning mixture models. Here is a press article on Biomedical Computation Review that talks about some of my work on privacy-preserving machine learning.

Here are the slides from a recent tutorial I gave with Anand Sarwate on differentially private machine learning. Here are the slides from a recent tutorial on non-parametric methods and adversarial examples.
