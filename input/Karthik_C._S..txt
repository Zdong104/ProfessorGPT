Karthik C. S.
Biography
Karthik C. S. is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University supported by a Simons Foundation Junior Faculty Fellowship and a grant from the National Science Foundation. He received his Ph.D. in 2019 from Weizmann Institute of Science where he was advised by Irit Dinur and his M.S. in 2014 from École Normale Supérieure de Lyon. He has held postdoctoral appointments at Tel Aviv University (hosted by Amir Shpilka) and New York University (hosted by Subhash Khot). He is broadly interested in complexity theory and discrete geometry with an emphasis on hardness of approximation, fine-grained complexity, and parameterized complexity.
