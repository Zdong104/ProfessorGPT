Office Hours : By appointment only. Please email me first.

I am an Assistant Associate Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at University at Buffalo, State University of New York. Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in EECS at Harvard from 2010-13. I received my M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Southern California in 2010.


My research interests are in algorithmic and systems challenges in Edge Computing Systems.

I'm teaching CSE 468/568: Robotics Algorithms in Fall 2021. Given the Fall 2021 enrollment in Masters programs, CSE 568 is currently full. Unfortunately, there is NOTHING i can do about this. I recommend you be patient, and more seats will open up as everyone figures out their class load.
