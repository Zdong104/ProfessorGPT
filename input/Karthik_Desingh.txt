Brief Bio:

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. I direct the Robotics: Perception and Manipulation (RPM) Lab.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar in Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, where I worked with Prof. Dieter Fox in the Robotics and State Estimation Lab.

My research focuses on addressing problems in robot sensing, perception, grasping, manipulation, and navigation. Specifically, I am developing algorithms that can enable a robot to perceive and interact with objects in our environments. My research interests lie primarily in understanding how to impart the intelligence to robots both toward general intelligence and robust intelligence. Broadly I get excited about solving problems in robotics, computer vision and machine learning.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. During my Ph.D. I was working in The Laboratory for PROGRESS headed by Prof. Chad Jenkins.

Prior to my Ph.D. I completed my Masters in Computer Science from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India, and Brown University. During my time at IIIT-Hyderabad, I was working in the Robotics Research Center headed by Dr K Madhava Krishna and was co-advised by Dr C V Jawahar from Center of Visual Information Technology (CVIT).
