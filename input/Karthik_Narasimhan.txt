Karthik R. Narasimhan

Associate Professor, Computer Science, Princeton University
Head of Research, Sierra

I work on problems at the intersection of language and decision making. I like to build autonomous agents that learn to operate in the world using both their own experience and existing human knowledge.

I received my PhD from MIT, advised by Prof. Regina Barzilay, and spent a year as a visiting research scientist at OpenAI in 2017-18.
