Description: Karthika Mohan
I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Oregon State University. Previously I was a postdoctoral scholar at CHAI in UC Berkeley, mentored by Stuart Russell. I completed my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at UCLA under the guidance of Judea Pearl.


Research Interests
My research interests lie in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Causal Inference. My research agenda for the next decade is motivated by the belief that in order to bring machines closer to human levels of intelligence, machine learning algorithms need to deal with the causal component of human reasoning.
