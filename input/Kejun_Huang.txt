Research Interests

I'm interested in the general area of Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Optimization, and Statistics. Some specific topics include:

Latent variable models with identifiability guarantees, which enables us to discover patterns in an unsupervised fashion, including nonnegative matrix factorization, bounded/independent component analysis, dictionary learning, and tensor decomposition.

Non-convex optimization algorithms that are computationally efficient and (hopefully) with optimality guarantees.

Applications in various areas, including data analytics, natural language processing, and computer vision.
