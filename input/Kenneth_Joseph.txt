About me

I am an associate professor in the CSE Department at the University at Buffalo. In the past, I was a postdoc at the LazerLab at the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University and a fellow at Harvard’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science. I completed my graduate work in the Societal Computing program in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied under Kathleen Carley in the CASOS lab.
