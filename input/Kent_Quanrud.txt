My research is about the design and analysis of algorithms in theoretical computer science. I have worked on approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, combinatorial optimization, continuous optimization, online learning, and discrete geometry. I am particularly interested in highly scalable algorithms for fundamental problems in optimization.

Teaching
Graduate algorithms: Spring 2024, Spring 2023, Spring 2021, and Spring 2020
Randomized algorithms: Spring 2024, Fall 2022, Fall 2020, and Fall 2019 (with Petros Drineas)
Undergraduate algorithms: Spring 2022
Advanced topics in algorithms: Fall 2021
