Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University and a part-time Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI. Before joining GMU, I was a full-time Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Rice University, advised by Professor John Mellor-Crummey. Previously, I studied at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Professor Guangming Tan’s PAA group. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student at Yunnan University, advised by Professor Wei Zhou.

GPA
GPA is a performance advisor for NVIDIA GPUs that suggests potential code optimization opportunities at a hierarchy of levels, including individual lines, loops, and functions. GPA uses data flow analysis to approximately attribute measured instruction stalls to their root causes and uses information about a program’s structure and the GPU to match inefficiency patterns with suggestions for optimization. GPA estimates each optimization’s speedup based on a PC sampling-based performance model.
Code
HPCToolkit
Our tool provides a profile view and a trace view for GPU-accelerated applications. The profile view identifies where GPU APIs are invoked in CPU calling context, approximates calling context for GPU execution, and analyzes instruction mix for GPU kernels. The tool traces CPU and GPU activities for a large number of processes and threads with minimal overhead.
Code DOC
Triton
Triton is a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment for expressing tensor math workloads that offers high flexibility, developer productivity and end to end performance.
Code DOC
GVProf
We implemented GVProf, the first value profiler that locates value redundancy problems in applications running on GPU-based clusters. Our experiments show that GVProf incurs acceptable overhead and scales to large executions. GVProf provides useful insights to guide performance optimization. Under the guidance of GVProf, we optimized several HPC and machine learning workloads, obtaining speedups up to 1.93x.
