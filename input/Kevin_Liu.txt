My lab creates new computational methodologies for efficient and accurate comparative genomic analyses – especially in the context of complex evolutionary scenarios – and then connects the resulting insights to phenotype and function.
The end goal of our big-data-driven approach is to generate hypotheses that result in new biological and biomedical discoveries.

A note to prospective students and postdoctoral researchers:
If you are interested in pursuing interdisciplinary research in bioinformatics and computational biology, I'd love to talk to you! Please email me.
