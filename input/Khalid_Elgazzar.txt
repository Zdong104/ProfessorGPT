Welcome to my home page

I am an Assistant Professor at The Center of Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette. I am also an adjunct assistant professor at Queen's School of Computing. Before joining CACS I was an NSERC posdoc fellow at Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. I received my PhD from Queen's University in 2013. My research interests span the areas of mobile and ubiquitous computing, distributed systems, context-aware cyber-physical systems, and elastic networking paradigms to cope with dynamic applications. My current research focus is on novel Ubiquitous Cloud paradigms and Internet of Things (IoT). Google Scholar Index.



I lead the IoT Research Lab at University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
