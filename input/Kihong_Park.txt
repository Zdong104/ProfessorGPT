Research Interest


My research concerns the theory and practice of computer networks and communication, network security, and fault-tolerant distributed computing. Specific subareas include:

    • Scalable QoS provisioning in IP networks
    • Multiple time scale traffic control and Internet traffic
    • Proactive protection against DDoS and worm attacks in power-law networks
    • Noncooperative network games with externalities
    • Stochastic cellular automata
    • Physical layer properties, performance, and dynamics of wireless LANs
