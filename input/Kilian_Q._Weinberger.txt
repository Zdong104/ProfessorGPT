My CS4780 Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems class is now on Youtube. If you are interested in more, you can earn an official Machine Learning Certificate through eCornell with especially designed problem sheets and high quality videos (with fancy 3D animations). Here is a video, if you want to learn more about my research philosophy.

If you are a Cornell student and want to get in contact with me, please just show up to my office hours (see link in side bar). Please do not email me unless absolutely necessary.

About me: I am married to (the amazing) Anne Bracy. Together we have three children, Timo, Koby and Nika. In my spare time I like running, reading, skiing, mountain biking, or boating on Cayuga Lake. Some books that I really enjoyed are The Three Body Problem Trilogy, a Gentleman in Moscow, The things they carried, and Never Let Me Go.
