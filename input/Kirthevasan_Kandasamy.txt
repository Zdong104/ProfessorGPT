I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Sciences, at the School of Computing, Data, and Information Sciences at UW-Madison. I am also affiliated with the Department of Statistics. I work on theoretical topics in machine learning and game theory. For more details, see my publications. Prior to UW-Madison, I was at UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. See here for a formal bio.

One of my current research agendas is on studying the incentives at play when agents (e.g organizations, individuals) share data with each other. We are developing mechanisms and marketplaces for data sharing which incentivize truthful contribution of data so as to benefit the agents and society at large.


Current teaching (Spring '24):   CS639 - Introduction to Algorithmic Game Theory & Mechanism Design

Openings: I am recruiting students with strong backgrounds in mathematics and statistics. If you are a PhD student at UW-Madison who is interested in working with me, please drop me an email (and follow up if I do not respond). Undergraduate students may also email me, but I prioritize students who have taken one of my classes.
Unfortunately, I am not always able to individually respond to such inquiries from prospective students who are not at UW-Madison. However, you may apply to the MS/PhD program at the Department of Computer Sciences and drop me an email.
