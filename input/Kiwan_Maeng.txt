KIWAN MAENG
Charles K. Etner Early Career Assistant Professor · Computer Science and Engineering · Pennsylvania State University (2022.8 --)
Postdoc Researcher · SysML Team · Meta AI Research (2021.8 -- 2022.8)
I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Pennsylvania State University. Prior to joining PSU, I did a one-year postdoc at Meta AI Research's SysML Team. I did my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, under the advisement of Professor Brandon Lucia. My research interest lies in systems for privacy-preserving machine learning in the broadest sense. I am interested in studying the privacy implications of modern ML systems and developing algorithm/system/hardware solutions for privacy-preserving ML training and inference. In the past, I've also worked on systems for ML, ML and sustainability, and batteryless energy-harvesting devices.

If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email elaborating the area of research you are interested in with respect to my research interests/recent publications. Please include your relevant background experiences (e.g., courses, projects, publication experiences) as much as possible.

I am also an amateur webtoonist. Check out my work if you know Korean. Otherwise, do not bother. My pronouns are: he/his/him.

Miscellaneous

I used to be an amateur webtoon--(web + cartoon)--ist. I used to draw cartoons about scientists and engineers on Facebook, and they were popular enough to become a real book! Do not bother clicking the link if you cannot read Korean :)
I haven't drawn any new episodes in years, but still I have things to boast:

I was awarded as 10 Authors of the Year 2017 by Chosun Ilbo (largest Korean newspaper).
My book was awarded as 10 Books of the Year 2017 by Munhwa Ilbo (newspaper), Books of the Year 2017 by Aladin (bookstore), Recommendations for Students By Librarians 2017 by Jeju Ilbo (newspaper), ranked 8th in Books of the Year Selected by Publishers SisaIN (magazine), and was nominated as Book of The Year by Donga Ilbo (newspaper).
My book was selected as Sejong-Books 2017 by Publication Industry Promotion Agency of Korea. No idea what it is but doesn't it sound fancy?
I donated all my profit from my first print in the hope to ease starvation in the République du Niger. Donation was made through Save The Children Federation, Inc.
My book was selected and now can be found in libraries of the Korean military (Republic of Korea Armed Forces), a.k.a., Jin-joong-moon-go.
I used to have 58 thousand followers on Facebook when Facebook was a thing.
