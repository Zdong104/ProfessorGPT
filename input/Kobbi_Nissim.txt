Description: Kobbi Nissim
McDevitt Chair in Computer Science

I am a Professor at the Department of Computer Science, Georgetown University and an Affiliate Professor at Georgetown Law. Prior to joining Georgetown, I was at the Department of Computer Science, Ben-Gurion University. From 2012 to 2017 I visited the Center for Research in Computation and Society (CRCS), Harvard University. I studied at the Weizmann Institute of Science, under the supervision of Prof. Moni Naor.

Research: I work towards establishing rigorous practices for privacy in computation: identifying problems that result from the collection, sharing, and processing of information, formalizing these problems and studying them towards creating solid practices and technological solutions. I am particularly interested in intersection points between privacy and various disciplines within and outside computer science including cryptography, machine learning, game theory, complexity theory, algorithmics, statistics, databases, and more recently privacy law and policy.

What is differential privacy? A definition of privacy (in the context of computing over personal data) introduced by 2006 by Dwork, McSherry, Smith and myself. See these documents for a gentle introduction: Differential Privacy: A Primer for a Non-technical Audience, Differential privacy: an introduction for statistical agencies, Designing Access with Differential Privacy.
