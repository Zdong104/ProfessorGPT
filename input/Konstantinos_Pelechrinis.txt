About Me

My name is Konstantinos Pelechrinis and I joined the University of Pittsburgh in Fall 2010, where I am an Associate Professor at the School of Computing and Information and I lead the Network Data Science Lab. Prior I received my Phd degree from the Computer Science department at the University of California at Riverside, under the supervision of Prof. Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy. Before joining UCR, I obtained my Diploma degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of the National Techincal University of Athens, where I worked with Prof. Vasileios Maglaris at the Network Management and Optimal Design Laboratory.

Research

My research interest include:

Network science
Urban informatics
Sports analytics

In more detail, my research interestes includes network science and the development of metrics and models for complex systems. I am involved in: (a) developing models and algorithms for intelligent urban services, (b) understanding the social, spatial, temporal and network dynamics of the behavior of people as captured through LBSNs, and (c) studying the effect of LBSNs on bussinesses.

I am also interested in the development of evaluation metrics for sports teams and players, as well as in the theoretical modeling of sports that will allow us understand deeper the game.
