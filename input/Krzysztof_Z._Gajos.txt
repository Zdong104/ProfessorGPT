Bio and Research Interests

I am a Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I lead the Intelligent Interactive Systems Group at Harvard. Currently, my group has the following focus areas:

Principles and applications of intelligent interactive systems. How do we build AI-powered systems such that they are well suited for the strengths and limitations of human cognition, perception and behavior?
Behavioral research at scale. We are building platforms (e.g., Lab in the Wild and Hevelius) that allow us to conduct behavioral research with tens of thousands of participants. We are interested both in developing new tools and methods, and in doing novel science that such tools enable.
Design for equity and social justice. Design impacts human behavior (seriously). Some of our design practices may inadvertently exacerbate inequalities. Thoughtful design can also improve support more equitable and more socially just outcomes. This interest originates from our work on accessible computing, but has expanded to include implicit bias, equitable access to healthcare, and more.

In the past, I made contributions in the following areas (which are still of some interest, just not the main focus of my current work): accessible computing, adaptive user interfaces, creativity support, crowd computing.

If you wish to see what I do, you can read a summary of the main research themes in my work or check out some of our tests on Lab in the Wild -- in 10 minutes you can learn something intersting about yourself and compare your results to the results of other people.

If you are interested in joining me as a graduate student, please apply through the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences or read the information for prospective graduate students.

Before Harvard

In June 2008, I graduated from University of Washington and I subsequently joined the Adaptive Systems and Interaction group at Microsoft Research for a one year post doc.

While at the University of Washington, I built the SUPPLE system for automatically generating personalized user interfaces. A short video illustrates how SUPPLE can generate user interfaces adapted to people's motor and vision abilities.

In the Fall of 2005, I was visiting faculty at the Ashesi University in Accra, Ghana, where I taught Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

Before coming to the University of Washington, I spent seven years at MIT where I earned my Bachelors and Masters degrees, and where I also worked for two years as a research scientist managing the operations of the Intelligent Room Project and coordinating some of the activities related to Project Oxygen at the MIT AI Lab (currently part of CSAIL).

News

Wednesday, May 20: Our paper showing that Proxy Tasks and Subjective Measures Can Be Misleading in Evaluating Explainable AI Systems was recognized as a best paper at the ACM IUI'20 conference. Here is a blog post summarizing the work.

Tuesday, May 12: 
Predictive text systems change what we write. When our phones suggest the next word to type, they not only help us enter text faster (well, sometimes), they also nudge us to change the content of what we write. Here's the paper and a blog post. This result extends our earlier work that showed that sentiment bias in predictive text recommendations results in biased writing.

2019

Monday, March 18: 
Our paper, SUPPLE: automatically generating user interfaces, which Dan Weld and I published in 2004, was recognized with The Most Impact Paper Award at IUI 2019. Here is a brief synthesis of the paper and our subsequent research.

2018

Monday, September 17: We have released the SEAS Climate Report with the results of the climate survey we conducted in the spring. Some key results: 1. Harassment and discrimination occur at SEAS and have large negative impact on all aspects of a person's life (personal well-being, professional development, and all other concepts we measured); 2. There are substantial disparities related to disability status, gender identity and minority status.

Saturday, August 3: 
We have just learned that Lahiru Jayatilaka's paper PETALS: Improving Learning of Expert Skill in Humanitarian Demining was recognized as a Best Paper of ACM COMPASS 2018.

2017

Friday, August 18: We have an open position for an HCI postdoctoral fellow.

Monday, March 27: 
I find myself re-explaining the same core design concepts in my classes year after year. To help myself and my students, I've started a Dictionary of Design Concepts to capture the really timeless and universal principles, design patterns, perceptual mechanisms, and other relevant concepts that designers of useful and usable interactive systems should know.

Wednesday, Feb 1: Our new paper in Environmental Health Perspectives: a system to report back individual results of biomonitoring studies to study participants. In the past, researchers feared that people could not handle the complex and potentially upsetting information about what chemicals were found in their tissues and environment. No more. If results are presented correctly, participants can understand and act on the results. Our system makes it easier to author and deliver personalized results at scale. This work was led by our colleagues at the Silent Spring Institute.

Monday, January 16: Our upcoming HRI'17 paper led by Serena Booth: can a robot talk its way into an access-controlled student dormitory? Robot succeeded in getting past the locked door 19% of the time when it asked an individual student to let it enter. When it asked a group of students, it succeed 76% of the time! But when the robot was dressed as a food delivery agent for the fictional start-up Robot Grub (and was carrying a box of cookies in a clear case), individuals suddenly became much more trusting: 71% of the individuals allowed the cookie-carrying robot into the dorm. Surprisingly, people who identified the robot as a potential bomb threat were just as likely to open the door as those who did not.

These results demonstrate the existence of overtrust---the belief that the robot does not intend to deceive or carry risk. 

Monday, January 9: 
Our upcoming ACM IUI 2017 paper reports new findings from the Multitasking Test on LabintheWild: given a choice to either do more clicking or exert more mental effort to get a job done, introverts and people with high need for cognition lean toward more mental effort, while extroverts and people with low need for cognition click more. This suggests that not all people benefit equally from some of the effort saving features of modern user interfaces. For more, see a blog entry that contextualizes the findings or read the paper.

2016

Thursday, Sept 22: 
On Thursday, Barbara and I will get to pontificate about science fiction. Can't wait! Barbara and I will be part of the Scholar Social after the evening performance of a science fiction-ish play Marjorie Prime at the Central Square Theater.

Wednesday, August 10: A new paper: Acceptance of Mobile Technology by Older Adults: A Preliminary Study" led by Sunyoung Kim, to be presented at MobileHCI '16 in Florence. This paper captures the results of our deep dive into the grounded theory method to understand how older adults make decisions about adopting (or not adopting) new mobile technologies. A key finding is that even if an older adult perceives a technology as useful and easy to use by others, they may still decide that the technology is too difficult for them to learn. This explicit stage of evaluating the ease of learning a new technology appears to be specific to older adults and does not appear in other technology adoption models.

Tuesday, July 12: 
Ofra Amir presented our paper introducing Mutual Influence Potential Networks: Enabling Information Sharing in Loosely-Coupled Extended-Duration Teamwork at IJCAI'16. This paper contributes to our larger effort to understand and support teamwork in complex healthcare.

Saturday, April 30: UIST 2017 will take place in Quebec City, October 22-25, 2017. I am the general chair. Jenn Mankoff and Chris Harrison will lead the program committee. Please help spread the word on FB and Twitter. 

Thursday, March 10: 
The currently prevalent one-size-fits-all approach to designing digital products inadvertently--but inevitably--leads to discrimination by making some people systematically a little more likely to succeed than others. That's the premise of my recent talk on Design and Discrimination. In it, I first show how current design practice discriminates against people based on their motor abilities, their ability to perceive color or their subjective perception of what is aesthetically pleasing. I then present a Computer Scientist's approach to this problem: algorithms that automatically personalize design to provide more equitable access to digital resources.

"Toward Collaborative Ideation at Scale â Leveraging Ideas from Others to Generate More Creative and Diverse Ideas" -- new crowd- and machine learning--powered system to pick out sets of diverse high quality examples of ideas generated by earlier contributors to inspire future contributors. Increases quality and diversity of generated ideas.
"Learnersourcing Subgoal Labels for How-to Videos" -- today's learners make tutorial videos even better for future learners by contributing to non-trivial human computation tasks as a byproduct of doing things that they are already motivated to do.
"LabintheWild: Conducting Large-Scale Online Experiments With Uncompensated Samples" -- data obtained through LabintheWild are as good as the data collected in traditional lab-based studies.
Final versions of these papers will be online in a few weeks.

Tuesday, August 12: The focus of this year's CS 279 will be social computing and crowd-powered systems. Specifically, we will look at the design and analysis of systems, in which crowds of intrinsically motivated volunteers contribute to meaningful and non-trivial human computation tasks as a byproduct of doing something that they are motivated to do anyway. The course is designed for first year grads from all areas. Advanced undergraduates are also welcome, particularly those who wish to do reserach (or write a thesis) in an area related to Human-Computer Interaction.

Friday, October 11: I have joined Tony Jameson as a co-Editor in Chief of the ACM Transactions on Interative Intelligent Systems (TiiS). I am helping fill the unfillable gap left by the passing of John Riedl, who was one of the two founding EICs of the journal. TiiS aims to be the primary venue for research that bridges HCI and AI (both broadly construed). Please consider submitting.

Sunday, Sept 22: Reminder: CrowdCamp applications are due on Sept 25! Next CrowdCamp (a two-day hack-a-thon for prototyping novel crowd-powered ideas) will take place at HCOMP'13 and will be lead by a great team: Lydia Childton (UW), Juho Kim (MIT) and Pao Siangliulue (Harvard).

Sunday, September 8: At HCOMP 2013, we will present a demo of Curio, a crowdsourcing platform that connects interested citizens with researchers to help answer important questions in the sciences and humanities. Read the abstract.

Monday, September 1: Detailed timeline is now available for CS 279: Topics in Human-Computer Interaction Research. The course is designed for first year grads from all areas and for dvanced undergrads, particularly those who wish to do reserach (or write a thesis) in an area related to Human-Computer Interaction. Special focus this year is on human-computer interaction research at scale, i.e., large-scale online experiments, crowdsourcing, and social media analysis. Class will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10-11:30am, in Pierce 100F.

Monday, July 22: on Monday, July 15, John Riedl passed away. John was best known for his pioneering work on recommender systems and social computing. I found John's research particularly admirable because it combined exciting technical contributions with deep insights into social psychology, thus merging the technical and the human in ways that were rigorous, informative and inspiring. Several years ago, John became the founding editor of the ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), a flagship journal for research combining advances in AI and Machine Learning with rigorous insights into Human-Computer Interaction.

Steven Snyder wrote a more extensive piece in memory of John. If you would like to honor John's memory in a more tangible way, you can donate to a scholarship fund set up by University of Minnesota in John's memory.




Saturday, July 20: At long last, we have published a data set to accompany our 2011 PlateMate paper. The data set contains 16 out of the 18 images we used to evaluate PlateMate's accuracy. The data set also includes the ground truth nutritional info for each photograph, expert estimates, as well as PlateMate's estimates.

Monday, June 24: We are gearing up to launch Curio, a crowdsourcing platform that connects interested citizens with researchers to help answer important questions in the sciences and humanities. Sign up now to receive an early access invitation!
