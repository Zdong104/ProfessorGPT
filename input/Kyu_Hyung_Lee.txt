About me:

I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science department at the University of Georgia and an Associate Director in the Institute for Cybersecurity and Privacy.
I have a Ph.D from the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I was co-advised by Dr. Xiangyu Zhang and Dr. Dongyan Xu. I got my Master and B.S in Computer Engineering from Hong-Ik University in Korea, and and my Master's thesis advisor was Dr. Sam H. Noh.
My research focuses on software security and cyber forensics. I am particularly interested in building practical solutions to improve the security and reliability of software and systems. I am also interested in developing fundamental primitives to analyze and investigate advanced cyber-attacks.


Research Interests:

Cyber security, Software reliability and security; Mobile Security; Program Analysis; Software engineering; Distributed Systems;

Prospective Students:

I am (always) looking for motivated (graduate and undergraduate) students with solid system and/or security background. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email.
