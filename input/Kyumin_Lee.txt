I lead Infolab at WPI. My primary research interests are in information retrieval, natural language processing, social computing, and machine learning/AI over large-scale online systems like the Web and social media. I focus on threats to these systems and design methods to mitigate negative behaviors (e.g., misinformation, hate speech), and look for positive opportunities to mine and analyze these systems for developing next generation algorithms and architectures (e.g., recommender system, natural language understanding). I also focus on AI for social good (e.g., disrupting wildlife trafficking networks).
