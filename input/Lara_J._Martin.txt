University of Maryland, Baltimore County
Hu| Researcher
How to say Lara 
I make systems that improve how people talk with computers and to each other through computers. Most of my career so far has been teaching computers how to tell stories (also known as automated story generation) and working my way towards an AI Dungeon Master. I am also currently working on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and speech technologies.
I run the LARA Lab and am a member of the Interactive Robotics and Language Lab (IRAL). My pronouns are she/they.

What NOT to do:
Please do not call me Mam/Ma'am. It does not match my gender identity and makes me very uncomfortable. Stick to Doctor/Dr. Martin, Professor/Prof. Martin, or even just Lara.
I'm not interested in your TOEFL/GRE scores or your past grades. They don't tell me much about how you will do with research. If you do want to tell me about your education, let me know if you've taken any classes that might be relevant to the research I do (e.g., an AI or NLP course).
What to do:
For current UMBC Masters/Undergrads:
I am currently not accepting new students.


For prospective PhD students:
The application deadline for the 2024-2025 school year has passed.


Funding
Your time and skills are valuable; you should never work for free. There are, however, some options for times when I don't have adequate funding for you.
Goldwater Scholars (undergrad only)
Undergraduate Research and Creative Achievement Day (URCAD) (undergrad only)
Undergraduate Research Awards (URA) (undergrad only)
Summer Research Scholarships (undergrad only)
Graduate Fellowships
