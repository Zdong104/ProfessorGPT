Research: Applied Logic
My general area of interest is applied logic: the study of mathematical and conceptual tools for use in computer science, linguistics, artificial intelligence and other areas.

Applied logic is applied mathematics. It is logic looking outward, reaching towards the diverse collection of worlds in which logic is used.
