Biography: 

Laxman Dhulipala is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science.

His research revolves around designing high-performance parallel, dynamic and streaming graph processing algorithms and systems, with a focus on both practical and theoretical efficiency.

Before coming to UMD, Dhulipala was a visiting researcher at Google Research NYC, where he collaborated with researchers in the Graph Mining team to build practical and theoretically-efficient parallel clustering algorithms for sparse graph-based data.

He received his doctoral degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2020. Dhulipala previously completed a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT.

In 2023, Dhulipala was part of a team honored with CMU's prestigious Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence for their breakthroughs in large-scale graph processing. He also received the 2018 best paper award at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures and the 2019 distinguished paper award at the Programming Language Design and Implementation conference.
