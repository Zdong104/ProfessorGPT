About Me - CV

Since July 1st 2020, I'm an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, College Park and a proud member of the PLUM lab. My research uses programming language abstractions to make it easier to write, debug, and reason about software and their specifications, with a particular focus on random testing, formal verification, and their interplay. If you share the same interests, send me an e-mail! You can find more information about my current projects:

Randomized Property-Based Testing and Fuzzing
Improving property based-testing, mainly for Coq and Python. Lots of details in the project page.
Efficient and Trustworthy Proof Engineering
Improving the quality of life for users of Proof Assistants like Coq.
