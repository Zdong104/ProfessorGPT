Description: Lerrel Pinto

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at NYU working on problems in Robotics and Machine Learning. If you are interested in joining my research group please read this.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, working with Alyosha Efros and Pieter Abbeel. Before this, I received a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, working with Abhinav Gupta.
