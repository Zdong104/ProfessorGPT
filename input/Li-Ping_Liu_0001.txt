Bio Sketch

I received my B.S. and M.S. in computer science respectively from Hebei University of Technology and Nanjing University LAMDA group. I completed my PhD at Oregon State University in 2016. My PhD advisor was Prof.â€‰Thomas Dietterich. Prior to joining Tufts, I worked as a postdoc researcher at Columbia University working with Prof. David Blei. Currently I am an assistant professor at the Computer Science Department of Tufts University.
