Description: Liang Huang
Professor of Computer Science, School of EECS
Professor (by courtesy) of Biochemistry & Biophysics
Faculty, Bioengineering Graduate Program
Affiliated Faculty, Center for Quantitative Life Sciences (CQLS)
Oregon State University (official profile)


I am a computational linguist and computational biologist, most fascinated by the shared mathematical foundations between the two.

Research Areas: NLP (simultaneous translation, parsing), compbio (RNA folding, RNA design, homologous folding, protein design), ML (structured prediction, weakly-supervised learning).
Research Focus: efficient algorithms and provable theory in the above areas.

2024/03: My Nature paper was featured in this College of Engineering story.
2024/02: We (PI Huang, co-PI Mathews) were one of the 9 teams nationwide to receive major funding for interdisciplinary RNA research. See news release from NSF/NIH.
2023/11: I gave a Distinguished Lecture at UW Paul Allen School of CSE (video).
2023/10: I gave an invited talk at the 11th mRNA Health Conference, co-organized by 2023 Nobel Laureate Katalin Kariko. Dr. Kariko commented on my work in her keynote.
2023/05: Landmark Nature paper (pre-)published (as an accelerated article preview); see also Nature news. I reduced mRNA design to lattice parsing (1961, Bar-Hillel construction, i.e., "the intersection of context-free and regular languages is still context-free").
2023/03: My first PhD student Ashish Vaswani (1st-author of the Transformer paper) was featured in this USC story about ChatGPT.

2021/06: Delivered CVPR 2021 Invited Talk.
2020/04: two ACL 2020 papers and one ISMB 2020 paper (linearpartition) accepted.
2019/06: Delivered ACL 2019 Keynote Speech (attended by 2000+ researchers).
2019/05: We have 3 ACL 2019 papers accepted.
2019/05: LinearFold is accepted by ISMB 2019 (top conference in bioinformatics and comp. bio.) and will appear in Bioinformatics in July.

2018/10: groundbreaking work in simultaneous translation -- first practical system that achieves high quality and low latency (done at Baidu Research). Media coverage by IEEE Spectrum, MIT Technology Review, FORTUNE, etc. Also covered by two podcasts: Data Skeptic and Eye on AI.
2018/09: Ph.D. student Mingbo Ma defended (4th PhD graduate) and will become a Research Scientist at Baidu Research (Silicon Valley).

2018/05: SIGMOD 2018 Best Paper Finalist.
2018/03: csrankings.org ranks OSU 15th in NLP (mostly our group), 20th in broad AI, and 36th in CS (in the US).
2018/02: We released the world's fastest RNA secondary structure prediction server, powered by the first linear-time prediction algorithm, based on our earlier work in computational linguistics. It is orders of magnitude faster than existing ones, with comparable or even higher accuracy. Code on Github.
2017/10: Serving as an Senior Area Chair (syntax/parsing) for ACL 2018.
2017/09: I'm giving an invited talk at EMNLP 2017 Workshop on Structured Prediction. [slides]

2017/06: Ph.D. alumni Ashish Vaswani's recent work on attention received a lot of attention itself, bringing a revolution in deep learning for NLP.
2017/06: Ph.D. student Mingbo Ma participated in the WMT 2017 competition on multimodal translation, and achieved the best TER score among 15 systems on the English+Image->German COCO task (the hardest task in that competition, since it's into German rather than French, and tested on out of domain images).
2017/05: Ph.D. student Kai Zhao successfully defended and accepted a rare Research Scientist offer from Google Research (NYC).
2017/05: We were part of the OSU team in the DARPA Explanable AI (XAI) grant ($6.5M total).
