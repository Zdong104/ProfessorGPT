Liang Zhao

Dr. Liang Zhao is an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science at Emory University. He was an assistant professor at the Department of IST and CS at George Mason University. He obtained his Ph.D. degree as an Outstanding Doctoral Student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech in 2017. His research interests include data mining, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, with special interests in spatiotemporal and network data mining, deep learning on graphs, nonconvex optimization, and interpretable machine learning.

He has published over a hundred papers in top-tier conferences and journals such as KDD, ICDM, TKDE, NeurIPS, Proceedings of the IEEE, TKDD, TSAS, IJCAI, AAAI, WWW, CIKM, SIGSPATIAL, and SDM. He won NSF CAREER Award in 2020. He has also won Cisco Faculty Research Award in 2023, Meta Research Award in 2022, Amazon Research Award in 2020, and Jeffress Trust Award in 2019, , and was ranked as one of the "Top 20 Rising Star in Data Mining" by Microsoft Search in 2016. He has won best paper award in ICDM 2022, best poster runner-up in ACM SIGSPATIAL 2022, Best Paper Award Shortlist in WWW 2021, Best Paper Candidate in ACM SIGSPATIAL 2022, Best Paper Award in ICDM 2019, and best paper candidate in ICDM 2021. He is recognized as "Computing Innovative Fellow Mentor" in 2021 by Computing Research Association. He is a senior member of IEEE.

My group is constantly searching for highly-motivated students. Those who are interested are encouraged to contact me: liang.zhao_at_emory_dot_edu.
