I am a Professor in Computer Science Department at University of Texas at Austin. I am also a member of the Wireless Networking and communications Group. My research interests are in Internet and wireless networking. I graduated with a Ph.D. from Computer Science department at Cornell UniversityÂ  in 2001. I spent 2001 - 2004 as a researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA. I joined UT Austin in January 2005. I am honored to chair ACM SIGMOBILE. I am National Academy of Inventors (NAI) Fellow, ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, and ACM Distinguished Scientist. I got an NSF CAREER award and Google Faculty Research Award, best paper awards at ACM MobiSys'18 and IEEE ICNP'17, and best paper runner-ups at MobiSys'17 and MobiCom'11. I supervised a PhD dissertation that won SIGMOBILE best dissertation award in 2020. My current research focuses on wireless and mobile systems. I have served as General co-chairs for IEEE ICNP 2012 and WICON 2007, and TPC co-chairs for ACM CoNEXT 2023, IEEE ICNP 2016, ACM MobiCom 2012, IEEE SECON 2011, and WICON 2006.
