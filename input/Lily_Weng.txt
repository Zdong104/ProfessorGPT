Lily Weng is an Assistant Professor in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. She received her PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from MIT in 2020, and her Bachelor and Master degree both in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University in 2011 and 2013. Her research interests focus on the intersection between deep learning, optimization and reinforcement learning, with applications in cybersecurity and healthcare. Specifically, her vision is to make the next generation AI systems and deep learning algorithms more robust, reliable, explainable, trustworthy and safer. She has worked on developing efficient algorithms as well as theoretical analysis to quantify and improving robustness of deep neural networks. In addition, her group has developed new automated interpretability tools to demystify deep learning models at scale.
