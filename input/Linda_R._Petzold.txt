Welcome to the Computational Science and Engineering Research Group

We focus on mathematical modeling and machine learning, applied to networked systems in biology and medicine.Current projects include development of algorithms and software for both simulation and inference of discrete stochastic systems, uses of machine learning applied to medical data to improve the care of trauma patients, mathematical modeling of brain processes in migraine, unraveling neural communication in learning, inference of network structure of communities of neurons, and mathematical modeling of the process of cell polarization.
