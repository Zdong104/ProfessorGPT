Short Bio

Prof. Dr. Ling Liu is a full professor in the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology and an elected IEEE Fellow. She directs the research programs in Distributed Data Intensive Systems Lab (DiSL). Her current research interests are centered on data and intelligence powered computing, such as artifical intelligence, machine learning, knowledge discovery and data mining, big data systems and analytics. Concretely, she is interested in developing innovative and efficient learning algorithms and systems for multi-modality of data, as well as algorithms and optimizations for improving performance, availability, security, privacy, trust of data and intelligence powered computing systems and applications, such as cloud and edge computing, distributed computing, Internet of smart things, Mobile computing and location based services, wireless and sensor networked computing, peer to peer and blockchain computing. Prof. Liu has published over 300 international journal and conference articles with high citations at Google scholar. Her research group has produced a number of open source software systems, among which the most popular ones include WebCQ,  XWRAPElite, PeerCrawl, GTMobSIM, SHAPE, NEAT, TripleBit (jointly with Prof. Pingpeng Yuan), MemFlex, MemPipe, XMemPod, AdaTrace, FUSE, Fed-CDP, LRBench, XEnsemble1.0, Data Poisoning in FL.

Prof. Dr. Liu is a recipient of IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement Award (2012) and an Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Advisor award from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012. Her research group has been a recipient of the best paper awards from numerous top venues, including ICDCS 2003, WWW 2004, 2005 Pat Goldberg Memorial Best Paper Award, IEEE Cloud 2012, IEEE ICWS 2013, Mobiqutious 2014, APWeb 2015, IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2015, IEEE Symposium on Big Data 2016, IEEE Edge 2017 and IEEE IoT 2017. Prof. Dr. Ling Liu has served as a general chair or a PC chair of numerous IEEE and ACM conferences in data engineering, very large databases, Big data, and distributed computing fields, and most recently, co-PC chair of the 2019 International Conference on World Wide Web. Prof. Liu has been on editorial board of over a dozen international journals, and served as the Editor In Chief of IEEE Transactions on Service Computing (2013-2016). Currently, Prof. Liu is the Editor in Chief of ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT). Prof. Dr. Liu's current research has been primarily sponsored by NSF, IBM, Intel and CISCO edge computing.
