About Me.

I am the Aravind K. Joshi Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, where I lead the Penn Computer Graphics Lab and I am also a member of the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception (GRASP) Lab.

Previously, I was a Lise Meitner Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Max Planck Institute for Informatics. I received my Ph.D. degree at the University of Hong Kong in 2019.

My research interests are at the interface of Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, and AI, with a focus on Neural Scene Representations, Neural Rendering, Human Performance Modeling and Capture, and 3D Reconstruction. I am especially excited about exploring a new genre of 3D reconstruction and rendering algorithms for human characters and general scenes, which combine classical computer graphics pipelines with deep learning techniques.

My long-term vision is to develop AI technologies that can perceive, understand and interact with 3D objects, people, and environments. Specifically, my research will pursue three goals:

(1) High-quality 3D reconstruction of real-world scenes from sparse inputs;

(2) Efficient and photo-realistic image synthesis of real-world scenes with 3D control;

(3) Large-scale 3D scene generation.

Prospective Students.

There are multiple open research positions in my Lab.

Topics of interest include:

Neural Representations and Rendering for 3D/4D Reconstruction
3D Generative Models
Physics-based Human Motion Generation
LLM guided Graphics and Vision
Neural Representations for Robotics
Other topics in Graphics and Vision

If you are interested in visiting or applying for a research position (e.g., intern, PhD, visiting PhD, or postdoc) in the lab, please fill in the form. You will be contacted if a fit can be found.
