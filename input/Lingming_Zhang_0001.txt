Dr. Lingming Zhang's main research interests lie in Software Engineering, and its synergy with Machine Learning, Programming Languages, and Formal Methods. He has published over 80 research papers, winning the ACM SIGSOFT Early Career Researcher Award, four ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards, and one Best Industry Paper Award. His research has helped detect 1000+ bugs for open-source projects from Apache and GitHub, as well as software systems from eBay, eMetric, Google, Meta/Facebook, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OctoML, Oracle, and Yahoo!. His work on regression testing optimization has been run day-to-day in Google, while his work on automated program repair and unified debugging has been successfully deployed to the Alipay system with million lines of code and over 1 billion global users. More recently, his work on ML system fuzzing has been adopted by NVIDIA developers. To date, his research has been supported by National Science Foundation (including NSF CAREER Award and NSF CRII Award), Google, Samsung, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alibaba, Kwai Inc, and Meta/Facebook.

Positions: I am looking for several Fall'24 PhD students interested in PL/FM/SE and/or Machine Learning (such as LLM4Code and ML System Reliability). Please apply to Illinois CS (with faculty interest) by Dec. 15th, and/or send me an email (with your CV).

Recent Services: LLM4Code 2024 (Organizer), OOPSLA 2024 (Associate Chair, Review Committee), ASE 2024 (Demos Co-Chair and AI&SE Area Chair), ICSE 2024, ISSTA 2024. Looking forward to your high-quality submissions!
