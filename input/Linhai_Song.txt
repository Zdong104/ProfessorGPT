About Me
I am an Associate Professor of Information Sciences and Technology College at the Pennsylvania State University.
My research interests span the areas of systems, security and software engineering. The goal of my research is to
help developers build more efficient, reliable and secure software systems.


I received my PhD from Wisconsin-Madison working with Prof. Shan Lu in 2015, my master in Institute of Computing
Technology at Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2010, and my bachelor in School of Software Engineering at Huazhong
University of Science and Technology in 2007. Before joining PSU in August 2017, I spent 1.5 years at FireEye, Inc.
