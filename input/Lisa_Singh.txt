lisa singh 
hello!

I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science in the College of Arts and Science and in the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. I am also the Director of the Massive Data Institute (MDI). My specialization is what I like to call - data-centric computing. It means that I work on lots of aspects of data driven computer science - data mining, data privacy, data science, data ethics. I also dabble in computational social science, working on problems with public policy implications. In general, I like working with noisy, messy, partial data to determine what its limitations are, what I can say about it, what I can learn from it in ethical, privacy-preserving ways, and how I can use this new found knowledge to improve outcomes for people.
