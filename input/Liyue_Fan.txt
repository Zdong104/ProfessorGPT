Liyue Fan

Assistant Professor

Dr. Liyue Fan is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science in the College of Computing and Informatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Her research is at the intersection of data privacy and databases. She was named one of the "Rising Stars in EECS" by MIT in 2015.

Prior to joining UNC Charlotte, Dr. Fan was an Assistant Professor in Information Technology Management at University at Albany. She spent two years as a postdoc research associate in the Integrated Media System Center at University of Southern California, under the supervision of Prof. Cyrus Shahabi. She received a Ph.D. in Computer Science & Informatics from Emory University (with Prof. Li Xiong) and a B.S.in Mathematics from Zhejiang University (a Chu Kochen ACEE alumna).

Dr. Fan serves the professional community as a PC member for SIGMOD, KDD, ICDM, AAAI, SIGSPATIAL, etc., and as a reviewer for many high impact journals, such as TKDE, TIST, TIFS, TMC, DAPD, and Computer & Security.

Research themes: Dr Fan's research has three pursuits: (1) quantifying the unintended information leakage in novel data sharing applications, (2) developing rigorous privacy-enhancing methods for data sharing and analysis, e.g., by building on the differential privacy model, (3) maximizing the utility of privacy-enhancing methods in practical settings, such as in healthcare and geospatial applications.
