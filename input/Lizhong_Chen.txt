Short Biography

Dr. Lizhong Chen is an Associate Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University and a core AI faculty member in the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute. His research interests are in the broad area of efficient computer systems (e.g., GPUs, accelerators, HPCs, IoT devices) and their applications in machine learning and natural language processing (especially large language models). Dr. Chen is a recipient of National Science Foundation (NSF) CRII Award (2016), NSF CAREER Award (2018), Best Paper Nomination at IEEE NAS (2018), Best Paper Runner-up Award at HPCA (2020), and Chu Kochen Award (the highest honor from Zhejiang University, China). He served as an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Computers, program committee members in top computer system and machine learning conferences, reviewers for a number of highly ranked journals, and panelists of multiple NSF panels related to computer systems. He is the founder and organizer of the Annual International Workshop on AIDArc (AI-assisted Design for Architecture). Dr. Chen is a Senior Member of the IEEE and ACM, and was an inductee of the HPCA Hall of Fame (2020).

Prior to joining Oregon State University in 2014, Dr. Chen was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Southern California (USC). He received his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from USC (advisor Dr. Timothy Pinkston) in 2014 and 2011, respectively, and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2009.
