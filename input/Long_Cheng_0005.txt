Biography

I received my second PhD in Computer Science (with a focus on cyber security) from Virginia Tech USA in 2018, and the first PhD (with a focus on wireless networking) from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications China in 2012. During the period from 02/2012 to 08/2015, I worked as a Research Fellow at Singapore University of Technology and Design, and then a Research Scientist at A*STAR Institute for Infocomm Research (I²R), Singapore. From 06/2009 to 10/2011, I was a research assistant at Hong Kong Polytechnic University and University of Texas at Arlington, respectively. I received the Best Paper Award from IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC) in 2013, the Erasmus Mundus Scholar Award in 2014, the Pratt Fellowship at Virginia Tech in 2017, Best Paper Award Runner-up from IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS) in 2019, Distinguished Paper Award frrom Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) in 2020, Best Paper Award from ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (AsiaCCS) in 2022. I am a recipient of an NSF CAREER award.
