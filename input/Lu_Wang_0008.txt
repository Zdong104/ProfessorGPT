Lu Wang 王璐

Lu Wang is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Michigan. Previously until 2020, she was at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University. She completed her Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, under supervision of Professor Claire Cardie.

Lu's research is focused on natural language processing, computational social science, and machine learning. More specifically, Lu aims to build trustworthy models that produce factual content and are calibrated according to their knowledge. She works on problems of summarization, generation, reasoning, argument mining, as well as novel applications that apply such techniques to understand narratives, media bias, and other interdisciplinary subjects. Her work won best paper honorable mention award at CHI 2023, outstanding paper award at ACL 2017, and best paper nomination award at SIGDIAL 2012.

Lu's work has been mainly funded by National Science Foundation (NSF, including a CAREER award), Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and industry partnerships.

Lu currently serves as ACL equity director. She is a co-founder and an officer of ACL Special Interest Group on Summarization (SIGSUMM).
