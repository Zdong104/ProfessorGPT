I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Computer Engineering Department at University of Arkansas. I received the BEng degree in computer science and engineering from University of Science and Technology of China, in 2008, and the PhD degree in computer science from Nanyang Technological University in 2013.

My research interests lie in the field of data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and distributed computing, particularly in discrimination/fairness-aware machine learning, causal modeling and inference, and data mining and privacy for genetic data.
