Public Domain Open Source Software by our research group at MIT:
FastMaxwell, [by Tarek El-Moselhy] An open-source, full-wave, 3D, electromagnetic solver for efficient extraction of interconnect structures above a substrate. The code is accelerated via the efficient discrete complex image method, efficient full-wave integration routines and an iterative precorrected fast Fourier transform matrix vector product. The code has been tested on a variety of large scale (up to 300,000 unknowns) structures.
Caplet [by YuChung Hsiao] A C++ open source capacitance extraction. Specialized instantiable basis function templates move the computational bottleneck of this integral equation solver from the non-embarrassingly parallelizable matrix solver to the embarrassingly parallelizable matrix setup phase. 90% parallel efficiencies have been demonstrated on tens of cores. “Real-time” capacitance extraction performance (could be used to generate 3D field solver accurate parasitic capacitance values while dragging and stretching wires with the mouse). CAPLET can directly handle GDS2 layout files into capacitance matrices in both GUI and command line interfaces. The internal extraction algorithm is specialized for VLSI interconnect structures but not exclusively, as long as the structure is of Manhattan geometry and embedded in uniform dielectric.
Squid  (stable quasiconvex identification) [by Kin Cheong Sou] An open-source matlab tool for the generation of reduced order linear system models from available transfer function data points. The tool is based on a quasi-convex relaxation of a system identification problem subject to stability and passivity constraints.
mmbasic: [by Brad Bond] Basic Moment Matching Tools (Matlab, Octave). A collection of Matlab functions for model reduction of linear systems via moment matching. This is intended as a teaching tool to illustrate how moment matching works.
newton1d: [by Brad Bond] Simple 1-D Newton solver (Matlab, Octave). A simple 1-dimensional Newton solver for Matlab. Plots each linearization as Newton progresses, a useful tool for teaching/learning about Newton's method and when it has trouble converging.
SMORES: [by Brad Bond] Simulation and Model Order Reduction of Electrical Systems. A Matlab circuit simulator that reads spice-like netlists and performs several types of analysis.
Stins (stable identification of nonlinear systems) [Brad Bond], A public domain open source matlab code for generating guaranteed stable compact models of nonlinear analog circuit blocks from input/output data (e.g. low noise amplifiers, mixers, or power amplifiers).

The code incorporates binary search to find minimum system order for given error bound. The final model is saved in a verilogA file which can be easily interfaced with commercial simulators such as spectre.
DecouplingMatrix_MRI [by Zohaib Mahmood] open source MATLAB code for automated design of a decoupling matrix connected between the power amplifiers and coupled RF arrays. This decoupling matrix mixes the input signals and transforms the impedance to ensure all forward power is delivered to the load
