Research

I do research on many aspects of computer security and privacy. I'm particularly interested in usable security and privacy, adversarial machine learning, the security of smarthomes, the risks of online tracking, and user authentication.

Here are some topics that I currently research:

Adversarial ML: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are becoming ubiquitous; they're used in applications from playing chess and predicting the weather to cancer diagnosis and self-driving cars. Our research attempts to discover how robust ML algorithms are in the face of an adversary. Specifically, we study whether an adversary can fool ML classifiers in practical settings without arousing the suspicion of a human. For instance, we showed that it is possible to 3d print a pair of eyeglasses that, when worn by an adversary, can cause a state-of-the-art face-recognition algorithm to identify the adversary as (a specific) someone else. We leverage what we learn of ML algorithms' weaknesses to design ML algorithms that are more resistant to attack.

Publications

Secure digital home / access control for non-security-experts: This collection of projects explores architectures, mechanisms, and interfaces for helping users manage access control in the digital home of the future and on online social networks. Recent research includes new methods to discover smart-home configurations that may leak information, new ways to specify access-control policies (e.g., reactively, and via metadata-based policy rules), and using machine learning to help users specify security policies and privacy preferences.

Publications

Security and privacy for the Internet of Things (IoT) outside the home: IoT devices are becoming ubiquitous. They enable fantastic new functionality, but also present new security and privacy risks. We try to discover these risks and develop solutions that address them.

Publications

Online tracking: While we browse the web our behavior is observed by online trackers, which construct profiles of users based on the websites we visit. These profiles are used to select ads and show content customized to our interests, but trackers also invade our privacy. We study how much tracking users are subjected to and whether tools like privacy-preserving web browsers and browser extensions like Ghostery can help.

Publications

Passwords: Although they are often insecure and inconvenient, passwords aren't quite about to disappear. This project's goal is to help users create passwords that are easy for them to remember, but hard for attackers to guess. We work towards this goal by trying to deeply understand the password-creation process and the security of the resulting passwords, including by investigating the effects of password-composition policies and password meters on the security and usability of passwords, and by studying metrics for quantifying password strength.
