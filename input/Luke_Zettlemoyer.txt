Bio
I am a Professor in the Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, and also a Research Scientist at Facebook. My honors include multiple paper awards, and being named an PECASE Awardee and an Allen Distinguished Investigator. Previously, I did postdoctoral research at the University of Edinburgh and earned a Ph.D. at MIT.
Research
My current research is in the intersections of natural language processing, machine learning, and decision making under uncertainty. I am particularly interested in designing learning algorithms for recovering representations of the meaning of natural language text. For more research details, please see my publications on Google and Semantic scholar pages.
