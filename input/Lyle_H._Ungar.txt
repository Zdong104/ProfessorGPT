Research Interests
My research group develops explainable machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing methods for psychology and medical research. Applications include the analysis of social media language and cell phone sensor data to better understand the drivers of physical and mental well-being. We, for example, are trying to better measure and understand empathy, stress, life satisfaction and friendship.
