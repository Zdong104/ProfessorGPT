About me

I study machine learning, causal inference, and the intersection between the two. My work focuses on building data-efficient causal inference methods in resource-constrained settings, and building robust predictive ML models using ideas from causality. Prior to UM, I completed my PhD in CSAIL, MIT and my bachelors degree in math and economics at Umass Amherst.

Joining my group

I am currently looking for PhD students to work with me. To get a better sense of my work and what my previous student collaborators have achieved please see the students page and the publications page.

Please read how to join before emailing me.
