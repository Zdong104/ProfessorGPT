Hello. I am Mahmood Jasim.

I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Division of Computer Science and Engineering at Louisiana State University. My research focuses on designing, developing, and evaluating decision-support systems to enable informed data-driven decision-making to address complex socio-technical problems and make more confident personal decisions. I combine techniques and methodologies from Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), Information Visualization, Applied Machine Learning, and Social Computing to build decision-support systems for informed data-driven decision-making.

I am currently recruiting Ph.D. students. If you are a prospective student and interested in my work, please reach out to me.
