Description: Mahsa Derakhshan

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY

I am an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. Prior to that, I was a FODSI fellow at UC Berkeley and also a Postdoctoral Researcher at Princeton University in the Department of Computer Science. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.

Prospective Students: If you are a student with a strong background in theoretical computer science and mathematics, and if you are interested in working with me, apply to our Ph.D. program and mention my name in your application. Feel free to contact me directly if you have questions.

Research Interests
I am broadly interested in the design and analysis of algorithms. Mainly, I study algorithms under uncertainty. A few sources of such uncertainty in my research are having stochastic data, limited access to information, and the presence of strategic behavior. I primarily study problems with applications to markets, such as matching markets and auctions.
