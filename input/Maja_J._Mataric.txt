I am motivated by the vast need for improving the human condition, and the equally vast potential for affordable human-centered technologies, such as socially assistive robotics (SAR), as means of empowering people and improving human quality of life. As a pioneer of SAR and founder and director of the Interaction Lab at the University of Southern California, my research is aimed at endowing machines with the ability to help people, especially users with differences. My lab's focus is on developing technologies that help people help themselves, using technology to augmentat human ability rather than to automate human work. I am passionate about conveying the importance and promise of interdisciplinary research and careers in STEM to all, with a particular focus on K-12 students and teachers, women and other underrepresented groups in engineering and the media.
