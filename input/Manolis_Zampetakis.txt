Manolis Zampetakis

Welcome! I am currently an assistant professor of Computer Science at Yale University.

Before Yale, I was a postdoc at the EECS Department of UC Berkeley working with Michael Jordan.

I received my PhD from the EECS Department at MIT where I was very fortunate to be advised by Constantinos Daskalakis. For my thesis, I was awared the ACM SIGEcom Doctoral Dissertation Award. In fall 2018, I received the Google PhD Fellowship.

I completed my undergraduate studies at NTUA where I was fortunate to work with Dimitris Fotakis.

My research interests include: Theoretical Machine Learning, Statistics, Optimization, Computational Complexity, Game Theory, Mechanism Design.
