Biography

My research interests are in Software Engineering and Programming Languages, with a focus on improving software reliability through program analysis and systematic testing. Software bugs are expensive and inevitable as software is mostly written by humans or automatically synthesized via ML. My research focuses at developing practical methods to prevent, detect, and fix bugs and vulnerabilities in code. As part of my research, I develop tools to automate software testing and debugging activities. 

Here is a sample of topics to illustrate what kinds of themes my team currently works on:

Runtime Verification 
Continuous Integration and Deployment
detection and prevention of flaky tests
repair of configuration files (e.g., Puppet, Docker, Ansible)
Autonomous Driving Vehicles

Research Areas
Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents
Cyber Security
Data Sciences and Analytics
Software Engineering and Programming Languages
