Ph.D. Torino (I) - Nancy (F)

I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science department at Boston University. My research is in computer science with a focus on Programming Languages, Formal Methods and Differential Privacy.

I am a member of the Principles of Programming and Verification (POPV) and of the Boston-area Data Privacy groups.

I am also Chief Scientist at DPella.
