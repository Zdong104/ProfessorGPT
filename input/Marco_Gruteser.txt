Bio

Marco Gruteser is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as Computer Science (by courtesy) at Rutgers University's Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB). He directs research in mobile computing, is a pioneer in the area of location privacy and recognized for his work on connected vehicles.

Beyond these topics, his more than hundred peer-reviewed articles and patents span a wide range of wireless, mobile systems, and pervasive computing issues. He has served as program co-chair or vice-chair for conferences such as ACM MobiSys, ACM WiSec, IEEE VNC and IEEE Percom. He has delivered nine conference and workshop keynotes, served as panel moderator at ACM MobiCom, and as panelist at ACM MobiSys, IEEE Infocom, and IEEE ICC. He was elected treasurer and member of the executive committee of ACM SIGMOBILE.

He received his MS and PhD degrees from the University of Colorado in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and has held research and visiting positions at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center and Carnegie Mellon University. His recognitions include an NSF CAREER award, a Rutgers Board of Trustees Research Fellowship for Scholarly Excellence, a Rutgers Outstanding Engineering Faculty Award, as well as best paper awards at ACM MobiCom 2012, ACM MobiCom 2011 and ACM MobiSys 2010. His work has been regularly featured in the media, including NPR, the New York Times, Fox News TV, and CNN TV. He is an ACM Distinguished Scientist.
