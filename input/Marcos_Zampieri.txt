I am an Assistant Professor at George Mason University where I lead the Language Technology Group.

I received my PhD degree from Saarland University where I was affiliated with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) part of the Saarland Informatics Campus.

My research interests are in computational linguistics and natural language processing. You can find a list of my publications here.

Activities

I served as Area Chair for ACL (2023, 2021, 2020), COLING (2022, 2018), EACL (2023), EMNLP (2022), and LREC (2022). I served as Tutorial Chair for ACL (2022).

I have been the lead organizer of the workshop on NLP for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects (VarDial) from 2014 to 2021 and a co-organizer since then. I have organized multiple shared tasks at SemEval such as OffensEval and LCP.

I co-edited Similar Languages, Varieties, and Dialects: A Computational Perspective and I am currently writing Automatic Language Identification in Texts for the Morgan & Claypool series Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies.
