Bio, Research, and Interests

Margaret Burnett is an OSU Distinguished Professor at Oregon State University. She began her career in industry, where she was the first woman software developer ever hired at Procter & Gamble Ivorydale. A few degrees and start-ups later, she joined academia, with a research focus on people who are engaged in some form of software development. She was the principal architect of the Forms/3 and FAR visual programming languages, and co-founded the area of end-user software engineering, which aims to improve software for computer users that are not trained in programming. She pioneered the use of information foraging theory in the domain of software debugging, and leads the team that created GenderMag, a software inspection process that uncovers gender inclusiveness issues in software from spreadsheets to programming environments. Burnett is an ACM Fellow, a member of the ACM CHI Academy, and an award-winning mentor. She has served in over 50 conference organization and program committee roles. She is also on the Academic Alliance Emeritus Chairs Council of the National Center for Women In Technology (NCWIT).

Recent talks
Gender-inclusive software:
Here's the recording of the CMU talk on "Doing Inclusive Design: From GenderMag to InclusiveMag" I gave in January 2020. This is probably my favorite video on the GenderMag method. (Length: about 1 hour including Q&A).
Podcast: Here's an OSU "Engineering Out Loud" interview on my research on gender-inclusive software. The NSF Science360 radio is featuring it.
Distinguished Prof Lecture: Here's my Distinguished Professor Lecture on Gender-Inclusive Software. (The actual talk starts around 3 minutes 45 seconds in.)
CHI'16: ACM has posted the GenderMag talk I gave at CHI'16 (20 minutes). The paper itself won a Best Paper Honorable Mention at CHI.
End-user software engineering: Here's an ACM webinar: "End-User Software Engineering: Beyond the Silos". I presented it on June 18, 2015, and it's now available for free from ACM on youtube. I'm the presenter and Brad Myers is the moderator.

Teaching
This year I'm teaching:
Fall 2023:
CS 468/568: (HCI 2) Inclusive Design with Personas. MW 10:00-11:50 (KEC 1001). This course is offered every year. Here is the class website.
Winter 2024:
CS567: Lab Studies in HCI and SE: (Canvas link). This course will cover how you go about designing, preparing for, running, analyzing, and writing-for-publication HCI/SE lab experiments involving human subjects. This is an end-to-end coverage of the entire process, and will put you in a position to conduct lab studies of your own with human subjects. (Here is the last pre-Canvas version of this course; this year's will be similar.)
Recently, I've also taught:
CS/ECE 507: EECS Professionalism, Ethics, & Diversity (Fall 2016).
CS 419/519: (HCI 2) Inclusive Design with Personas. This course is now offered every year; starting Fall 2018 its number became CS 468/568.
CS519: Personas Methods in HCI and User-Centered Design (Winter 2015).
CS 569/589: Special topics: Empirical lab studies of software development (Winter 2014). This course will cover how you go about designing, preparing for, running, analyzing, and writing-for-publication lab experiments of programming situations involving human subjects. This is an end-to-end coverage of the entire process, and will put you in a position to conduct lab studies of your own with human subjects.
CS 565: (HCI 1 for grads) Introduction to HCI. This course is offered every year. Here is the 2019 version: http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/spring2019/cs565.
CS 569: Special topics: Empirical methods for field (case) studies in software engineering (Fall 2014). This course deals with the type of empirical study known as the "case" study. These are studies that collect data from natural software development situations as they really occur in the field, in which the researcher does not manipulate or "control" anything. The course is an end-to-end coverage of the process. We will mainly focus on case studies involving human software developers in the field. You will actually conduct a field study as part of this course. The course does not cover lab studies.
CS 564: FIELD STUDIES IN SE AND HCI (Winter 2021). This course deals with the type of field study known as the "case" study. These are studies that collect data from natural software-based situations as they really occur in the field, in which the researcher does not manipulate or "control" anything. The course is an end-to-end coverage of the process. We will focus on case studies involving human users in the field. You will actually conduct a field study as part of this course. The course does not cover lab studies.
CS 584 (Fall 2013).
CS 352: (HCI 1 for undergrads) Usability engineering. Here is Winter 2019's pre-Canvas version.

Where do my grad students and postdocs end up?

Nine of my PhDs/postdocs became professors at various colleges and universities.
Three became researchers/scientists in academic research institutes or industrial research labs (Carnegie-Mellon, IBM Research, Microsoft Research).
The rest of my PhD students and postdocs (and some of my MS students too) have become senior UX (User Experience) researchers at companies like Google and Microsoft.
Most of the rest of my MS students became software developers, tech company administrators/gurus, and/or went on to get more degrees that brought them into positions in business, aviation, ...
