I am a professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin, and an affiliate faculty member in the Department of Computer Sciences. I am the Director of the NIH/NLM-funded Computation and Informatics in Biology and Medicine (CIBM) Training Program, and a member of the Carbone Cancer Center, and the Center for Genomic Science Innovation.

I am also involved in the large and vibrant machine learning and quantitative biology research groups at the University of Wisconsin.

I was the Director of the Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping, which was one of the NIH's Centers of Excellence for Big Data Computing.
