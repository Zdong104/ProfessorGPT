About Me

Welcome! I am interested in how people's goals, values, and motivations structure their thoughts, decisions, and interactions with others.

My research combines approaches from cognitive science, social psychology, neuroscience, and computer science to develop novel computational theories of cognitive and social processes as well as identify design principles for building intelligent systems that interact with humans.

Bio

Before September 2023, I was a Faculty Fellow / Assistant Professor at NYU's Center for Data Science and a post-doc in the Computer Science and Psychology departments at Princeton University, where I worked with Tom Griffiths and Jonathan Cohen on developing computational theories of human problem solving. Previously, I was affiliated with the Learn and Verify Group in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley. I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from Brown University, where I worked with Joseph Austerweil and Fiery Cushman on teaching and social learning. I also received my M.S. in Computer Science working with Michael Littman on interactive machine learning. As an undergraduate at Princeton, I majored in Philosophy and minored in Computer Science, and Gil Harman advised my senior thesis. I'm originally from New York City and currently live there.
