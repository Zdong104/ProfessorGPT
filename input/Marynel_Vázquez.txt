Interests:

Marynel Vázquez is a computer scientist and roboticist. Her research focuses on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), specially in multi-party settings. For instance, her work investigates social group phenomena in HRI, like spatial patterns of behavior and group social influence. Also, her work aims to advance perception and decision making algorithms to enable autonomous, social robot behavior in multi-party settings. A key idea that has driven her recent work is abstracting human-robot interactions as graphs. This allows robots to reason about individual, relationship and group factors in unison. Marynel enjoys building systems to demonstrate ideas in practice, including new robots and infrastructure that can facilitate HRI research. Marynel's research approach is interdisciplinary: it combines elements of computer science (especially artificial intelligence), behavioral science, and design.
