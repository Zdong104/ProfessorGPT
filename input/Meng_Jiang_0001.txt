Meng Jiang

I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. My research fields are data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing. My data science research focuses on graph and text data for applications such as material discovery, recommender system, question answering, education, and mental health. [C.V.]

My recent projects focus on knowledge-augmented NLP, auto-instruct LLM, self-correct LLM, harm-unlearned LLM, graph neural networks, graph data augmentation, and graph diffusion transformer.

I am directing the Data Mining towards Decision Making (DM2) Lab, supported by National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Naval Research (ONR), Amazon, Snap, Cond√© Nast, and ND International.
