Biography

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Data Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), with a joint appointment in the Department of Computer Science. I lead the Trustworthy Machine Learning Research Lab (TMLR lab). Before that, I earned the Ph.D. in Computer Science from Texas A&M University, under the supervision of Dr. Xia Hu. I have previously worked/interned with companies such as MSR, Adobe Research, and Intel. I also work closely with Dr. Ben Shneiderman of University of Maryland, and developed a website for Human-Centered AI.

My research interests lie within the domain of trustworthy machine learning, with a particular emphasis on explainability, fairness, and robustness. Additionally, I am intrigued by the intersection of trustworthy machine learning with large language models (LLMs). We summarize our recent efforts in trustworthy LLMs here.

I’m actively looking for strong and motivated students. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to email me. Please check here for more details.
