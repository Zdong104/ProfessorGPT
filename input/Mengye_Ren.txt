Bio

Mengye Ren is an assistant professor of computer science and data science at New York University (NYU). Before joining NYU, he was a visiting faculty researcher at Google Brain Toronto working with Prof. Geoffrey Hinton. He received B.A.Sc. in Engineering Science (2015), and M.Sc. (2017) and Ph.D. (2022) in Computer Science from the University of Toronto, advised by Prof. Richard Zemel and Prof. Raquel Urtasun. From 2017 to 2021, he was also a senior research scientist at Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) and Waabi, working on self-driving vehicles. His research focuses on making machine learning more natural and human-like, in order for AIs to continually learn, adapt, and reason in naturalistic environments.

Research

Areas: machine learning, computer vision, representation learning, meta-learning, few-shot learning, brain & cognitively inspired learning, robot learning, self-driving vehicles

My key research question is: how do we enable human-like, agent-based machine intelligence to continually learn, adapt, and reason in naturalistic environments? I am interested in the emergence of intelligence by learning from a point-of-view experience. Current research topics in my group are:

Memorization and forgetting in sequentially changing environments

Visual representation learning in the wild using egocentric videos

Few-shot learning, reasoning, and abstraction in vision and language

Human-AI alignment in personalized AI
