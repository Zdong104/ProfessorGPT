Mike Hughes - Machine Learning Research

Welcome! My research spans statistical machine learning and its applications in healthcare and the sciences.

I am an Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Computer Science at Tufts University and a primary faculty member for the Tufts Machine Learning research group. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in computer science at Harvard SEAS, advised by Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by Prof. Erik Sudderth (now at UC-Irvine).

Research Highlights

First, my lab pursues methodological advances in statistical machine learning:

probabilistic models for multivariate time-series (see papers from NeurIPS 2021 or AOAS 2014)
semi-supervised learning with generative models (AISTATS 2018, Time Series Workshop 2021, and AABI 2022)
optimizing early warning classifiers to control false alarms (AISTATS 2022)
optimizing deep learning to be more interpretable (AAAI 2020 and AAAI 2018)
generalizing to new subjects given limited data (UIST 2021 and NeurIPS datasets track 2021)
generalizing across dataset shifts (MLHC 2019)
Bayesian nonparametrics for adapting model complexity (BNPy Python package and NeurIPS 2015)

Second, I pursue high-impact clinical and scientific applications of these techniques:

automating preliminary diagnosis of heart disease using echocardiograms (MLHC '21, J Am Soc Echo '23)
predicting patient risks in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (CHIL '20 paper and MIMIC-Extract code)
recommending stable antidepressants personalized to patients (JAMA Network Open 2020)
forecasting demand for hospital resources during the COVID-19 pandemic (MLHC '21)

Easy Variational Inference for Categorical Models via an Independent Binary Approximation
Led by Mike Wojnowicz, a data scientist at Tufts DISC

Linear models with categorical outcomes can be tough to fit in Bayesian fashion, especially when number of categories are large. We show how classic Bayesian auxiliary variable methods (probit, logit) for one-hot binary models can be justified as principled surrogates of a new class of truly one-of-K categorical models via a likelihood bound. While it has been common for decades to train many simple binary classifiers via a "one vs rest" (aka one vs all) paradigm, the statistical justification for this choice has often been questioned. This work offers a firm foundation for why this independent binary approximation may be successful.

[Apr 2018] Best Paper Award at SoCalNLP 2018

Our winning 2-page short paper was a compact summary of our AISTATS 2018 paper: Semi-Supervised Prediction-Constrained Topic Models. Thanks to co-author Gabe for presenting the work, to the SoCal NLP organizers for hosting, and to Amazon for sponsoring the award.

[Jan 2018] Paper accepted to AISTATS 2018.

Our paper -- Semi-Supervised Prediction-Constrained Topic Models -- describes a new framework for training topic models and other latent variable models to improve supervised predictions while still providing good generative models with interpretable topics. The new approach fixes core issues with past methods like sLDA, and shines especially in semi-supervised tasks, when only a small fraction of training examples are labeled.
