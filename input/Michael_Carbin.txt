Research Interests

I lead the MIT Programming Systems Group. My group investigates the design, semantics, and implementation of language-driven systems. We have a current focus on systems that operate in the presence of uncertainty in their environment (perception), implementation (neural networks or approximate transformations), or execution (unreliable hardware).
