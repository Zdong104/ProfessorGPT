About Me

I am currently the founding chair of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Until recently I was part of a large cohort of faculty, staff, and students at UIUC that do great work in security called the Security and Privacy Research Group at Illinois (SPR@I).

If you are interested in what I have done professionally, you are welcome to read my CV.

Teaching

As the founding chair, I do not currently teach courses at GaTech, as I am busy working with the faculty and staff to create new undergraduate threads, expand our professsional masters program, and explore a new Cybersecurity and Privacy Ph.D.. Last year the SCP added some amazing courses including: The Psychology of Cybersecurity, Critical Infrastructures Security and Resilience, and Security Operations and Incident Response. Much much more to come.

In the past I have taught a variety of systems classes including Operating Systems, Networking, Distributed Systems, and Security. The most recent classes included:

Spring 2022, ECE 422 Computer Security I, Course Website
Fall 2021, ECE 391 Computer Systems Engineering, Course Website
Collaborators

I am currently looking for 1-2 Ph.D. students to join me for the '24-'25 AY.

Before coming to GaTech, I was blessed to have had an incredible cohort of UIUC Ph.D. students who have graduated and moved on to do some amazing things:

Dr. Paul Murley, Argonne National Laboratory
Prof.Joshua Reynolds, New Mexico State University
Prof. Deepak Kumar, Univesity of California, San Diego
Prof. Zane Ma, Oregon State University

I was super grateful to have had the chance to work with Dr. Joshua Mason while at UIUC.

Research
My interets lie in exploring the security, performance, and availability properties of computing systems. My work seeks to both inform the development of these systems to address immediate, important societal problems as well as to fundementially enhance our understanding of the sciences underlying computing subfields including computer systems organization, networks, and security and privacy.
