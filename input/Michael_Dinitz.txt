I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science department, with a secondary appointment in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, at Johns Hopkins University.

My research interests are in Theoretical Computer Science, with an emphasis on approximation algorithms, and applications to computer networking and distributed computing.

I am a member of Algorithms and Complexity group and the Mathematical Institute for Data Science at JHU.

My work has been supported by various NSF grants, including a CRII grant, an AitF grant, and Algorithmic Foundations grants (first, second).
As a graduate student I was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, as well as an ARCS Scholarship.

Ph.D., Carnegie Mellon University, 2010. Advised by Anupam Gupta.
A.B., Princeton University, 2005. Advised by Sanjeev Arora.
