Biography

Michael Everett is an assistant professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. He earned his bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

His research areas include robotics and machine learning, and he has published two papers. His research focuses on the intersection of robotics, deep learning, and control theory. Everett’s goal is to develop certifiable learning machines, in which robots can safely, reliably, and efficiently perform tasks. Some specific techniques of interest are reinforcement learning, model predictive control, and navigation in challenging environments.

Currently, Everett works as a visiting faculty researcher with Google’s People + AI Research (PAIR) team. Previously, he was a research scientist and postdoctoral associate at the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Outside of the lab, he enjoys scuba diving and playing frisbee with his dog, Holly.
