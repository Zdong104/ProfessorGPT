RESEARCH INTERESTS

My research interests include topics in machine learning, artificial intelligence, algorithmic game theory and microeconomics, computational social science, and quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. I often examine problems in these areas using methods and models from theoretical computer science and related disciplines. While much of my work is mathematical in nature, I also often participate in empirical and experimental projects, including applications of machine learning to problems in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance, and human-subject experiments on strategic and economic interaction in social networks.

Aaron Roth and I have written a general-audience book about the science of designing algorithms that embed social values like privacy and fairness; here is the publisher's description:

Over the course of a generation, algorithms have gone from mathematical abstractions to powerful mediators of daily life. Algorithms have made our lives more efficient, more entertaining, and, sometimes, better informed. At the same time, complex algorithms are increasingly violating the basic rights of individual citizens. Allegedly anonymized datasets routinely leak our most sensitive personal information; statistical models for everything from mortgages to college admissions reflect racial and gender bias. Meanwhile, users manipulate algorithms to "game" search engines, spam filters, online reviewing services, and navigation apps.

Understanding and improving the science behind the algorithms that run our lives is rapidly becoming one of the most pressing issues of this century. Traditional fixes, such as laws, regulations and watchdog groups, have proven woefully inadequate. Reporting from the cutting edge of scientific research, The Ethical Algorithm offers a new approach: a set of principled solutions based on the emerging and exciting science of socially aware algorithm design. Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth explain how we can better embed human principles into machine code - without halting the advance of data-driven scientific exploration. Weaving together innovative research with stories of citizens, scientists, and activists on the front lines, The Ethical Algorithm offers a compelling vision for a future, one in which we can better protect humans from the unintended impacts of algorithms while continuing to inspire wondrous advances in technology.

BRIEF PROFESSIONAL BIO

Current:

Since 2002 I have been a professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania, where I hold the National Center Chair. I have secondary appointments in the department of Economics, and in the departments of Statistics and Data Science and Operations, Information and Decisions (OID) in the Wharton School. I am the Founding Director of the Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences, where my Co-Director is Rakesh Vohra. I am the faculty founder and former director of Penn Engineering's Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS) Program, whose current directors are Andreas Haeberlen and Aaron Roth. I am a faculty affiliate in Penn's Applied Math and Computational Science graduate program. Until July 2006 I was the co-director of Penn's interdisciplinary Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.

Since June 2020, I am an Amazon Scholar, focusing on fairness and privacy in machine learning and related topics within Amazon Web Services.

I have worked extensively in quantitative and algorithmic trading on Wall Street (including at Lehman Brothers, Bank of America, SAC Capital and Morgan Stanley; see further details below). I often serve as an advisor to technology companies and venture capital firms, and sometimes invest in early-stage technology startups. I occasionally serve as an expert witness or consultant on technology-related legal and regulatory cases.

I am an elected Member/Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Association for Computing Machinery, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and the Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory.

The Past:

I spent the decade 1991-2001 in machine learning and AI research at AT&T Bell Labs. (Here is an epic photo of Labs staff from 1995, there are many famous scientists peppered throughout.) During my last four years there, I was the head of the AI department, which conducted a broad range of systems and foundational AI work; I also served briefly as the head of the Secure Systems Research department. The AI department boasted terrific colleagues and friends that included Charles Isbell (now at Georgia Tech), Diane Litman (now at University of Pittsburgh), Michael Littman (later at Rutgers, now at Brown), David McAllester (now at TTI-Chicago), Satinder Singh (now at University of Michigan), Peter Stone (now at University of Texas), and Rich Sutton (now at University of Alberta). Prior to my time as its head, the AI department was shaped by the efforts of a number of notable figures, including Ron Brachman (who originally founded the department; now at Cornell Tech), Henry Kautz (who led the department before heading to the University of Washington; now at the University of Rochester), and Bart Selman (now at Cornell). Before leading the AI group, I was a member of the closely related Machine Learning department at the labs, which was headed by Fernando Pereira (later at Penn, now at Google), and included Michael Collins (later at MIT and Columbia, now at Google), Sanjoy Dasgupta (now at UCSD), Yoav Freund (now at UCSD), Rob Schapire (later at Princeton, now at Microsoft Research), William Cohen (now at CMU), and Yoram Singer (later at Hebrew University and Google, now at Princeton). Other friends and colleagues from Labs days include Sebastian Seung (later at MIT, now at Princeton), Lawrence Saul (later at Penn, now at UCSD), Yann LeCun (now at Facebook and NYU), Roberto Pieraccini (now at Jibo), Esther Levin (now at Point72), Lyn Walker (now at UC Santa Cruz), Corinna Cortes (now at Google), and Vladimir Vapnik (now at Facebook).

I spent 2001 as CTO of the European venture capital firm Syntek Capital, and joined the Penn faculty in January 2002.

From June 2018 to June 2020, I led applied research in the AI Center of Excellence at Morgan Stanley, along with Yuriy Nevmyvaka (with whom I have also collaborated on a number of papers on algorithmic trading ).

From June 2016 to March of 2018, I was the Chief Scientist of MANA Partners, a trading, technology and asset management firm based in NYC. From early 2014 to June 2016, I led a quantitative portfolio management team with Yuriy Nevmyvaka at Engineers Gate. From June 2009 through September 2013, we were PMs in the MultiQuant division of SAC Capital in New York City. From May 2007 through April 2009, we led a quantitative trading team at Bank of America in New York City, working on both proprietary and algorithmic trading strategies within BofA's Electronic Trading Services division. From the Spring of 2002 through May 2007, I was first a consultant to, and later the head of, a quant prop trading team within the Equity Strategies group of Lehman Brothers in New York City.

I spent most of 2011 on sabbatical in Cambridge, England, where I visited the University of Cambridge Economics Department and was a visiting Fellow at Christ's College. I also spent time visiting Microsoft Research Cambridge.

I have served as an advisor to the startups Yodle (acquired by web.com), Wealthfront, Activate Networks, RootMetrics (acquired by IHS), Convertro (acquired by AOL), Invite Media (acquired by Google), SiteAdvisor (founded by Chris Dixon; acquired by McAfee), PayNearMe (formerly known as Kwedit), and Riverhead Networks (acquired by Cisco). I was also involved in Dixon's startup Hunch (acquired by eBay), and have been a consultant to Bessemer Venture Partners.

In the past I have served as a member of the Advanced Technology Advisory Council of PJM Interconnection. the Scientific Advisory Board of Opera Solutions, and the Technical Advisory Board of Microsoft Research Cambridge. I am a former member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Alan Turing Institute, and of the Market Surveillance Advisory Group of FINRA, and a former external faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute.

EDUCATION

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of California at Berkeley in math and computer science, graduating in 1985. I received a Ph.D. in computer science from Harvard University in 1989. The title of my dissertation was The Computational Complexity of Machine Learning (see Publications below for more information), and Les Valiant was my (superb) advisor. Following postdoctoral positions at the Laboratory for Computer Science at M.I.T. (hosted by Ron Rivest ) and at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley (hosted by Dick Karp ), in 1991 I joined the research staff of AT&T Bell Labs, and later the Penn faculty (see professional bio above).

Alongside my formal education, I was strongly influenced by being raised in an academic family, which included my father David R. Kearns (UCSD, Chemistry); his brother, and my uncle Thomas R. Kearns (Amherst College, Philosophy); their father, and my paternal grandfather, Clyde W. Kearns (University of Illinois, Entomology); my mother Alice Chen Kearns, who was an early influence on my writing; and her father, and my maternal grandfather Chen Shou-Yi (Pomona College, Chinese History and Literature).

NOTE: The main result of the paper above --- an efficient algorithm claimed to find a single exact Nash equilibrium in tree graphical games --- is unfortunately wrong. This was discovered and discussed in the very nice paper by Elkind, Goldberg and Goldberg, which can be found here. The problem of efficiently computing an exact Nash equilibrium in trees remains open (though EG&G demonstrate that no two-pass algorithm can suffice). The original polynomial-time approximate Nash algorithm from the K., Littman, Singh UAI 2001 paper is unaffected by these developments, as is its NashProp generalization in the Ortiz and K. 2002 NIPS paper.
