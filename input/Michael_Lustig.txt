Biography
ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± ðŸ’”ðŸ’” I, Michael (Miki) Lustig am an Israeli faculty at UC Berkeley. I'm shocked, depressed, outraged and heartbroken by Hammas' terror attack on my country and the murderous rampage on the innocent civilians. I call for the immediate release of the >200 kidnapped by Hammas. Bring them home!

Michael (Miki) Lustig is a slightly above average Professor in EECS with well below average sense of humor. He joined the faculty of the EECS Department at UC Berkeley in Spring 2010. He received his B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology in 2002. He received his Msc and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 2004 and 2008, respectively. His research focuses on computational imaging methods in medical imaging, particularly Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Miki is a jolly good Fellow of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.
