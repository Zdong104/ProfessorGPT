about

My research investigates foundational questions about responsible machine learning. Much of this work aims to identify problematic behaviors that emerge in machine-learned models and to develop algorithmic tools that provably mitigate such behaviors. More broadly, I am interested in how the theory of computation can provide insight into emerging societal and scientific challenges.

Prior to Cornell, I was a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by Shafi Goldwasser.
I completed my Ph.D. in the Stanford Theory Group under the guidance of Omer Reingold.
