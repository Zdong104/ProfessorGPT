I recently joined the AI research team at Salesforce. Prior to that, I was with the robotics team at Google DeepMind (and formerly Google Brain) for 5.5 years. I also hold a tenured position in the Department of Computer Science (CS) at Stony Brook University as an associate professor. Previously, I was an assistant professor at Indiana University Bloomington, and was a staff researcher within the Robotics Section of the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). I received my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008 and B.S. from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2004.
