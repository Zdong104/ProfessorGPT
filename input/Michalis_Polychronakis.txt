About

I am an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University. My research aims to improve the security of computer systems and networks, build defenses against malicious software and online threats, reinforce the privacy of our online interactions, and enhance our understanding of the internet and its darker sides.

I received the BSc ('03), MSc ('05), and PhD ('09) degrees in Computer Science from the University of Crete, Greece, while working as a research assistant in the Distributed Computing Systems Lab at FORTH-ICS. Before joining Stony Brook, I was an associate research scientist at Columbia University. More information is available in my CV.
