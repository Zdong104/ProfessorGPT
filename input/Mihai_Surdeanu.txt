My primary appointment is with the Computer Science department at the University of Arizona. I have a courtesy appointment with Linguistics and Cognitive Science. Before Arizona, I was a research scientist in the NLP group at Stanford and chief scientist of Lex Machina. I did my PhD in computer science at Southern Methodist University.

I work on systems that process and extract meaning from natural language texts such as question answering (answering natural language questions), information extraction (converting free text into structured relations and events). I focus mostly on interpretable models, i.e., approaches where the computer can explain in human understandable terms why it made a decision.
