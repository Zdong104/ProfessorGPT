CV

Research:
My research more broadly covers artificial intelligence, and machine learning. My research work is often motivated by biomedical informatics problems and applications. More specifically, my current work develops machine learning technologies for analysis of high dimensional time-series data in electronic health records (EHRs), patient state modeling, extraction and representation of biomedical knowledge and its combination with ML methods. One of the aims of my work is to deploy the AI models at bedside to perform real-time clinical monitoring and alerting, real-time patient assessment, real-time adverse event detection. Finally, my most recent research is on control and optimization of complex biological and clinical processes.
