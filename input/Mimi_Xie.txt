Bibliography

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Before I joined UTSA in August, 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. (CV)

My research focuses on design and optimization of efficient, intelligent, and secure computer system and architecture in the broad area of Internet-of-Things (IoT). I am taking an interdisciplinary effort spanning cutting-edge topics including emerging non-volatile memory technology, intermittently powered system, and intelligent algorithms to address the challenges in processing/transmitting unprecedented volume of data and powering all these devices. My work has been published in top conference and journal venues (e.g., DAC, ICCAD, DATE, EMSOFT, ASP-DAC, ACL, IEEE TCAD, ACM TCPS, ACM TOSN etc.).
