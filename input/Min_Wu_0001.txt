Biography: 

Min Wu is a Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. She is also the Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs in the A. James Clark School of Engineering, a Distinguished Scholar-Teacher and has an appointment in the Institute for Systems Research.

Wu leads the Media and Security Team (MAST) at UMD with main research interests in information security and forensics and multimedia signal processing.

Wu has authored two books and holds eight U.S. patents. Two of her journal papers were honored with best paper awards from the IEEE Signal Processing Society and EURASIP, respectively.

She received an NSF CAREER award in 2002, a University of Maryland George Corcoran Education Award in 2003, an ONR Young Investigator award in 2005, and a University of Maryland's College of Engineering Junior Faculty Teaching Award, and an IEEE Mac Van Valkenburg Early Career Teaching Award in 2009. Wu was selected for a TR100 award by the MIT Technology Review Magazine in 2004 as one of the 100 top young innovators whose contributions to emerging technologies will profoundly influence the world, and received a Computer World “40 under 40” Young Innovator Award in 2007 as one of 40 innovative IT people under the age of 40.

She is the president of the IEEE Signal Processing Society (2022 to 2025), and the first woman of color to hold the leadership position in the organization's 73-year history. Before that, she served as the IEEE SPS's vice president-finance (2010 to 2012) and chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Information Forensics and Security (2012 to 2013). Wu has also served as area editor for IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, where she was responsible for creating its monthly "Inside Signal Processing eNewsletter," and is involved in several other technical committees, journals and conferences. She was elected as an IEEE Fellow for contributions to multimedia security and forensics.

Before coming to the University of Maryland in 2001, she worked with NEC Research Institute and Signafy, Inc. in 1998, and with Panasonic Information & Networking Laboratories in 1999. She was a visiting associate professor at Stanford University from 2007 to 2008.

Wu received her B.E. degree in electrical engineering (automation) and a B.A. degree in economics from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, in 1996, and a doctorate degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University in 2001.
