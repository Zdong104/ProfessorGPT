Biography

Minchen is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, having joined in September 2023 after leaving his role as an assistant adjunct professor at UCLA Department of Mathematics, AIVC Lab. He was a postdoctoral researcher in the SIG Center for Computer Graphics at the University of Pennsylvania after completing his Ph.D. in the same group, advised by Chenfanfu Jiang. Minchen is a winner of the 2021 ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award and the 2021 Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA) Doctoral Dissertation Award. His Ph.D. dissertation features the Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) method, which "presents a breakthrough in the notoriously challenging and long-standing problem of robust frictional contact simulation in nonlinear solid dynamics with guarantees of non-intersection" and has led to a series of follow-up works in both academia and industry. Minchen received his M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia in 2018, advised by Alla Sheffer.



Simulation Intelligence Group (SIG)

The efficacy of solid and fluid simulation methods in the evolving landscape of visual computing, manufacturing, and robotics industries is fundamentally determined by robustness, efficiency, accuracy, and versatility. However, achieving a harmonious balance among these crucial characteristics remains an open challenge. The Simulation Intelligence Group (SIG) led by Minchen is committed to advancing the frontiers of physical simulation by striving for unprecedented levels of performance in all these areas, leveraging a comprehensive approach that combines numerical analysis, high-performance computing, and machine learning. SIG is part of Carnegie Mellon Graphics Lab.

Opportunities

We are eager to welcome highly motivated and skilled Ph.D. students! If you have a strong background relevant to our research areas and are interested in joining us, you can apply to any of the Ph.D. programs within the School of Computer Science. We recommend prioritizing the Ph.D. in Computer Science program and listing Minchen as a potential advisor. Here are some details about our Ph.D. stipends. Applications with fellowships from external sources are also welcome!

Our group actively invites visiting students and scholars from around the globe to foster interdisciplinary collaborations. Prospective visits usually range between 6 to 12 months. While we provide funding support, candidates are also welcome to explore alternative funds from their home institutions, third-party fellowships, etc. The availability of the positions is limited. If you are interested, please email us with the materials listed here. Students interested in a summer research internship/volunteer [2024 closed] can directly email us their CV, transcripts, and specific research interests aligned with our research focus. We appreciate your understanding that, due to a high influx of emails, we may not be able to respond to all inquiries.

If you are a CMU student interested in working with us, please feel free to forward your CV and specific research interests via email. We strongly recommend embarking on this path by taking foundational and research-focused computer graphics courses, especially 15-462 and 15-769. While our group has limited slots for independent studies and research assistant roles under reduced course load, we remain receptive to diverse forms of collaboration, e.g., SURA, SURF, etc.

We are also open to engaging in collaborations of any kind, both within academia and industry!
