I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania. I also hold a secondary appointment in the Electrical and Systems Engineering Department. Previously, I received my Ph.D. from MIT, working with Prof. Dina Katabi, and my B.S. from Peking University.

Research Interests:
Wireless technologies: sensors and systems with novel sensing capabilities.
Machine learning & graphics: principled methods for multi-modal learning and sensing.
Digital health: contactless health monitoring and digital biomarker discovery.
Robust robotic perception: robots that continue to sense in adverse conditions.
Please check the video highlights and the dissertation about my past research.
Updates:
Starting at UPenn (Jan 2023).
My Ph.D. thesis received ACM SIGMOBILE Doctoral Dissertation Award Runner-up.
Had great time at Emerald Innovations deploying my Ph.D. research at scale.
Successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis (Oct 2021)!
I co-organized the Multi-Modality Learning from Videos and Beyond tutorial at ICCV 2021.
Our work on monitoring and assessing medication administration is online at Nature Medicine.
My research on sleep and activity sensing lets doctors monitor COVID-19 patients from a distance.
We showed a real-time demo of Through-Wall Human Pose Estimation and Activity Recognition at ECCV 2020.
I co-organized the Contactless Health Monitoring with AI tutorial at CVPR 2020.
We showed a real-time demo of Through-Wall 3D Human Pose Estimation at SIGCOMM 2018.
EQ-Radio received CACM Research Highlights and ACM SIGMOBILE Research Highlights.
EQ-Radio is the topic of an entire episode in The Big Bang Theory!
