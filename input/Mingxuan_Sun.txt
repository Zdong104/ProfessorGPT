About me
I am an Associate Professor in the Division of Computer Science and Engineering in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Louisiana State University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012. I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky in 2006 and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University, China in 2004. I was a Senior Scientist with the playlist recommendation group, Pandora Media, Inc. from 2012 to 2015.



To prospective students: I am looking for motivated graduate students and visiting scholars. If you are interested, please e-mail me at msun 'AT' csc 'DOT' lsu 'DOT' edu with your CV and transcripts.
