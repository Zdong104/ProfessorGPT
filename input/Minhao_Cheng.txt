I am an assistant professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles under the supervision of Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh. Before joining Penn State, I was an assistant professor of Computer Science & Engineering at HKUST. My research interest is broadly on machine learning with a focus on trustworthy machine learning and AutoML.
