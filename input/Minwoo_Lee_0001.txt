I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and School of Data Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte (Charlotte). I am working on machine learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. My interests focus on various topics in machine learning, with an emphasis on reinforcement learning, such as interpretational learning, transfer learning, sparse learning, multiagent learning, fine control based policy development and robust knowledge augmentation. Recent research focuses on analysis of learning behavior with sparse Bayesian learning.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Colorado State University in 2017, advised by Chuck Anderson.
