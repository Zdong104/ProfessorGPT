Welcome



I am looking for PhD students and postdocs with interests and expertise in embedded systems, formal methods, AI, learning and controls, robotics, and cyber-physical systems!

I am the Dickinson Family Associate Professor in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science and the director of the Cyber-Physical Systems Lab (CPSL) at Duke University. 
My research interests focus on design and analysis of cyber-physical systems with varying levels of autonomy and human interaction, at the intersection of (more traditional) areas of embedded systems, AI, learning and controls, formal methods and robotics.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. I also received Dipl. Ing. (5 years) and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from University of Belgrade, and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UPenn.

I am an associate editor in the ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare (ACM HEALTH) and a co-chair of the 2019 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS'19).

I have received various awards including

Dickinson Family Professorship, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University
2019 ACM SIGBED Early Career Researcher Award
2019 IEEE TCCPS Early-Career Award
ONR Young Investigator Award
NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award
Nortel Networks Professorship, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University
ACM SIGBED/SIGSOFT Frank Anger Memorial Award
EMSOFT'17 Best Paper Award
ICCPS'14 Best Paper Award
RTAS'12 Best Student Paper Award
IBM Faculty Award, 2018
Joseph and Rosaline Wolf Best Dissertation Award from Penn Engineering
Honeywell User Group Wireless Innovation Award
Three additional Best Paper Finalists Awards (TACAS'12, ICCPS'14, EMSOFT'19)
