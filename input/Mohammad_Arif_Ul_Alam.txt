Research

My research focuses on on Interactive, Cognitive, Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing. I am also interested in deep learning, big data analytics, optical spectroscopy and their application in healthcare and life sciences. We mainly research on human accessibility that leverages a network of connected biomedical devices, sensors and AI aided cognitive systems to help people with disabilities.
