I am a Guggenheim Fellow (2019), an ACM Fellow (2018) (the youngest in the class of 2018 fellows), an AAAS Fellow (2023), an IEEE Fellow (2020), an EATCS Fellow (2020), a Blavatnik National Awards for Young Scientists Honoree (2020), a Washington Academy of Science Distinguished Career Awardee (2023), a University of Waterloo Alumni Achievement Medal (2022) Recipient, and the Jack and Rita G. Minker Professor of Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland at College Park. I am also affiliated Professor with Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland. In addition, I hold a Research Affiliate position in MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). I am also a Permanent Member of Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS) at Rutgers. I was also a Visiting Scientist in the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at University of California, Berkeley, in Fall 2016, Spring 2018, and Fall 2018.

      My research is supported in part by NSF CAREER Award, ONR Young Investigator Award, Google Faculty Research Award (twice), Northrop Grumman Faculty Research Award, University of Maryland Research and Scholarship Award (RASA), AT&T Research Labs, and a few other DARPA and AFOSR grants. I also thank European Association for Theoretical Computer Science for EATCS Nerode Prize, 2015 (awarded for our outstanding JACM paper on our Bidimensionality Theory, which was the topic of my Ph.D. thesis; see below for more info).

      Regarding my industry experience, since January 2019, I am also an Amazon Scholar with Amazon Sponsored & Display Advertisement Division. Before I was a Visiting Research Scientist at Google AI- Research, New York City, in 2017-2018. I was also a Visiting Researcher in Microsoft Research at New England and New York City Labs in 2016. Before joining UMD in 2010, I was a Senior Researcher in the Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science group at AT&T Labs - Research from 2007. During my doctoral studies, I also worked as an intern at Microsoft Research Theory group in 2004 and Department of Mathematical Sciences at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in 2002.

      Regarding my education, I have been one-year Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (with ALADDIN project) and a one-year Postdoctoral Associate in MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) from which I also earned my Ph.D. under supervision of Professor Erik D. Demaine  and Professor Tom Leighton (Sep. 2001- May 2005). I got my M.Sc. from the Computer Science Department of the University of  Waterloo  (Sep. 2000- Sep. 2001) and my B.Sc. from the Computer Engineering Department of Sharif University of Technology  (Sep 1997-Sep 2000).
