I direct the SOLAR (Sustainability, Optimization, Learning, and Algorithms Research) Lab. Our research is centered on carbon-intelligent computing (application) and data-driven online optimization (theory). In the SOLAR Lab, we develop rigorous algorithms using data-driven online optimization and learning tools that are applicable in several domains such as data center energy optimization, electricity market, electric vehicles, smart energy systems, and networking applications such as multimedia networking and edge/cloud networking. Our research is supported by a Google Research Faculty Award, an NSF CAREER Award, and other grants from NSF, Amazon, Adobe, and VMWare.
