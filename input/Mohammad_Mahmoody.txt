CV | Teaching | Advising | Publications | Service | Talks

I am an associate professor in the Computer Science Department of the University of Virginia (UVA).


I am a theoretical computer scientist. In particular, I am interested in theoretical aspects of cryptography and their interplay with computational assumptions. I am also interested in theoretical aspects of machine learning. In all of these areas, I am mostly interested in understanding the inherent barriers, also known as "lower bounds", "impossibility results", or "separations".
