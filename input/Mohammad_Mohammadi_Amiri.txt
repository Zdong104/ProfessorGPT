Biography

My research interests revolve around the theme of enabling decentralized intelligence. Consider the continuously increasing number of connected devices with the emergence of the Internet-of-Things paradigm and various smart sectors generating a significant amount of data. Tailoring machine learning algorithms to exploit this massive amount of data can lead to many new applications and open-up new markets in medical care, finance, and enabling ambient intelligence. Due to the privacy concerns and the growing storage and computational capabilities of edge devices, it is increasingly attractive to store and process the data locally by shifting network computations to the edge. This enables decentralized intelligence where local computations on the data converts decentralized data to a global intelligence; hence, enhancing data privacy while learning from the collection of data. My research focuses on creation of a collective intelligence using all the data that is inherently decentralized and only visible to its owner. Information about one of my latest research projects can be found here. 

I received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology in 2011 and the M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2014, both with the highest rank in classes. I also obtained the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London in 2019. I then spent two years from 2019 to 2021 as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University supervised by Prof. Vincent Poor and Prof. Sanjeev Kulkarni. I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Media Lab where I am working under the supervision of Prof. Ramesh Raskar.

I received the Best Ph.D. Thesis Award from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London, as well as the IEEE Information Theory Chapter of UK and Ireland in the year 2019. I am also the recipient of the IEEE Communications Society Young Author Best Paper Award (2022) for the paper titled "Federated learning over wireless fading channels". 

My research interests include machine learning, information and coding theory, wireless communications, privacy and security, distributed computing, and signal processing.
