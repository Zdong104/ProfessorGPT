Description: Mohsen Ghaffari






I am an Associate Professor in the EECS Department of MIT, where I hold the Steven and Renee Finn Chair. My research is in theoretical computer science, with a focus on distributed and parallel algorithms. Before joining MIT's faculty, I was fortunate to be on the CS faculty of ETH Zurich (tenured in 2022), and I received my PhD from MIT in 2016.

I am grateful for the generous support of the European Research Council (starting grant DistMaP, 2019—2024), the Swiss National Science Foundation (project grant 200021_184735, 2019—2023), and Google (Faculty Research Award, 2019).



PhD positions: If you're interested in working with me and my team and have a strong algorithmic background, please submit an application to our PhD program and mention my name. Unfortunately, I am not able to answer individual emails.
