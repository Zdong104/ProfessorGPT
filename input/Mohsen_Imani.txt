I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at UC Irvine and also a director of the Bio-Inspired Architecture and Systems (BIASLab). My group consists of 40+ talented members, including about 20 PhD students, working on a wide range of practical problems in the areas of machine learning, bio-inspired computing, and intelligent systems. Our research goal is to design a fully interpretable, hyperdimensional cognitive framework capable of real-time prediction and reasoning over complex data (e.g., shoplifting, accidents, or any user-defined anomalies). Our approach fundamentally enhances large-scale AI systems by providing hierarchical abstraction for autonomy, enabling generalization, and fostering human-AI collaboration. My team is also focused on real-time intelligent sensing tailored for highly sparse and selective data generation. This approach ensures that sensors produce only the data necessary for learning, incorporating an attention mechanism to heighten focus on the relevant task and improve situational awareness.
​
Bio: Dr. Imani received his Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. Dr. Imani is one of the pioneers in hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and its applications in the cognitive learning domain. He boasts an impressive publication record with over 170 papers in top conferences and journals and holds 20 US patents. His contributions have paved a new path in brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing, enabling ultra-efficient and real-time cognitive learning. His research has been a key factor in initiating multiple programs at the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Intel, IBM, and CISCO. Dr. Imani's research has earned him several prestigious awards, including the DARPA Young Faculty Award 2023, the SRC Young Faculty Award 2023, the ONR Young Investigator Program Award 2023, the DARPA Riser 2022, the Bernard Gordon Engineering Leadership Award, and the Outstanding Researcher Award. He has also received six best paper awards and nominations at top conferences. Dr. Imani has a long history of successful technology transfers to multiple companies and governmental agencies.
Plan to take CS 295 Brain-Inspired Learning Systems
(open to both graduate and undergraduate)
I'll be teaching CS 295: Brain-Inspired Learning Systems in the Spring of 2024. The course focuses on brain-inspired machine learning and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on new developments in neuro-symbolic AI models. The course is highly recommended for students who are looking for internships or jobs related to the machine learning domain. Both graduate and undergraduate students are welcome to take the course. The course requires no prior expertise, except for basic programming in Python.
