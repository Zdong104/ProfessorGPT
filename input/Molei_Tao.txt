What do I do?

As an applied & computational mathematician, I design and apply mathematical tools from nonlinear dynamics, probability, geometry, multiscale methods, numerical analysis and computational math, and control theory to solve practical problems.

A major application I'm interested in is the mathematical and algorithmic foundation of machine learning. This includes

sampling, optimal transport, and (diffusion) generative modeling

deep learning theory, and optimization

AI4Sciences (astronomy, quantum sciences, bioengineering, scientific computing, mechanical engineering, material sciences, chemistry, …)

Interested in joining my group?

We already have a great team, but if you are truly motivated, you can still email me and/or indicate an interest in working with me in your application. 1 PhD student position can be created for exceptional candidate. The currently planned area is scientific machine learning (a.k.a. AI4Science), but interests in all areas will be considered. Due to the large volume of inquiries, I may not be able to reply to all of them, but each will at least be read carefully. Examples of relevant Ph.D. programs include Math, CSE, Machine Learning, and ACO (email if uncertain). Thank you for your interest.
