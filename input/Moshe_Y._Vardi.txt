Description: 

It's been a long road ... Play
Motto:
Theorems are forever!
The proof, the whole proof, and nothing but the proof!
Sapere aude! ("Dare to know!")
Observations:
The Peter Principle: Employees tend to rise to their level of incompetence.
The Vardi Amendment: But when managers reach their level of incompetence, they are simply promoted to a higher level in a different organization, as this is the easiest way to get rid of them.
Murphy's Law: If anything can go wrong, it will!
The Vardi Amendment: Anything that human beings can do, someone will do!
Vardi's Principle of Emotional Intelligence : People are fully responsible for their own emotions, but that does not give you permission to be inconsiderate of their emotions.



Moshe Y. Vardi

Moshe Y. Vardi is University Professor, Karen Ostrum George Distinguished Service Professor in Computational Engineering at Rice University, where he is leading an Initiative on Technology, Culture, and Society. His interests focus on automated reasoning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence with broad applications to computer science, including machine learning, database theory, computational-complexity theory, knowledge in multi-agent systems, computer-aided verification, and teaching logic across the curriculum. He is also a Faculty Scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.
