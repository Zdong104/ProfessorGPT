Google Scholar profile


I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Riverside.

Research interests. My research interests broadly lie in the areas of computational imaging, signal/image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. I design algorithms to learn and exploit latent signal structures for fast and efficient information recovery.

Current research focus is on computational imaging (physics-based and data-driven approaches), adversarial attacks and defenses for robust computer vision, multi-task and multi-modal machine learning, and wearable sensors for health monitoring and rehabilitation.

Positions available

Prospective PhD students: I am looking for new Ph.D. students to join my group for projects related to computational imaging and multi-modal machine learning.

A successful candidate should have solid understanding of Linear Algebra, programming (Matlab and Python), basics of Convex Optimization, and interest in tinkering with hardware prototypes (no special skills needed, but should be able to assemble a lego set with or without instructions).

Important: If you send me an email, please include your CV/resume and a brief statement of your research interests. I try to respond to as many emails as I can, but please do not be offended if you do not receive a response.

UCR offers PhD admissions in Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters. Please look at Graduate admissions page for details.

Undergraduate students: If you are at UCR and want to work on computational imaging, machine learning, or computer vision, get in touch.
