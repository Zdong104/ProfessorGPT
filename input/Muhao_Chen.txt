I am an Assistant Professor at Department of Computer Science at UC Davis. I direct the Language Understanding and Knowledge Acquisition (LUKA) Lab. My research focuses on robust and minimally supervised data-driven machine learning for natural language Processing. Most recently, my group's research has been focusing on accountability and security problems of large language models and multi-modal language models. Previously, I was an Assistant Research Professor of Computer Science at USC from 2020 to 2023, and a Postdoctoral Fellow with Dan Roth at UPenn from 2019 to 2020. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at UCLA in 2019, where I worked with Carlo Zaniolo, Kai-Wei Chang and Wei Wang. Before joining UCLA as a Ph.D. student, I graduated with a Bachelor degree from Fudan University in 2014 where I worked with X. Sean Wang.



News 	
I am looking for highly motivated PhD/MS/Undergrad students to join the LUKA Lab. More information is available at here.
Education 	
Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Sept 2014 - June 2019.

B.S. in Computer Science, Fudan University, Sept. 2010 - June 2014.
