Description: Nael B. Abu-Ghazaleh
Professor, Computer Science and Engineering
I am a professor in the CSE department at UC Riverside.  My research is in computer systems, with broad interest including computer architecture support for security, and graph processing. I also think about security and privacy of emerging systems including most recently AR/VR, Large Language Models, and autonomous systems. Some of my earlier work was in networking and distributed systems, and parallel computing.
