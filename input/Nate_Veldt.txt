[CV]

My research focuses on combinatorial algorithms and computational methods for data analysis, especially data that can be modeled by a graph or network. This combines interests in CS theory, computational science, discrete mathematics,  and various data science applications.

New and Events
July 22-25, 2024. My co-author Vicente Balmaseda will be at ICML this year presenting our research on improved combinatorial algorithms for cluster deletion.
July 8-12, 2024. Attended SIAM Discrete Math to give a talk on hypergraph clustering and chair a minisymposium on Applied and Computational Discrete Algorithms.
May 12-17, 2024. Attended the Dagstuhl Workshop on “Discrete Algorithms on Modern and Emerging Computer Infrastructure” in Wadern, Germany.
May 6-9, 2024. Attended the Toronto Metropolitan University as an invited speaker for the upcoming workshop on “Modelling and Mining Complex Networks as Hypergraphs“.
May 01, 2024. Our paper on improved combinatorial algorithms for cluster deletion was accepted at ICML 2024. Joint work with Vicente Balmaseda, Ying Xu, and Yixin Cao.
January 8-10, 2024. My paper “Growing a Random Maximal Independent Set Produces a 2-approximate Vertex Cover” appeared at SOSA 2024 (Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms).
