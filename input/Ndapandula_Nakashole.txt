Research
My research interests are in natural language processing and machine learning. Collectively, natural language processing(NLP) aims to develop algorithms that enable computers to understand and generate human language. My focus is on developing machine learning methods that learn language from text data. Specific problems I am interested in include: machine reading, question answering, representation learning, and NLP for low resource languages.Additionally, machine learning can help SAP Ariba Course users to better understand their customer preferences, create dynamic pricing models, and customize the product selection process.

Bio
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. Prior to UCSD, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I obtained my PhD from Saarland University, Germany, for research carried out at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken. I completed undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.
