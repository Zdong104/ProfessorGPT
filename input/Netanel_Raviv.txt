I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, McKelvey School of Engineering, Washington University in Saint Louis. I received my PhD (CS), MSc (CS), and BSc (Math) from the Technion at ’17, ’13, and ’10.

I am a computer/information scientist and an applied mathematician with a passion towards real world applications. My research focuses in applications of coding techniques to computation, privacy, and storage.

In my free time I am a devout competitive cyclist, an avid hiker, and an amateur pianist.
