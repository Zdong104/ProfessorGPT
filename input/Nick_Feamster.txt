I am Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

I direct the Network Operations and Internet Security research lab, where we develop data-driven tools and systems to improve Internet security, performance, and adoption. Join us!

I am the founder and co-director of the Internet Equity Initative, a cross-disicplinary research center aimed at making Internet access more equitable.

I am also the Director of Research at the Data Science Institute, which is a university-wide initiative to promote data science research and education at the University of Chicago.

I design and deploy network protocols and systems that make the Internet work better. I use empirical network measurement and machine learning to understand and improve network performance, security, and privacy. The results of my research often have implications to policy. I regularly work with federal and municipal organizations, including the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the City of Chicago on equitable Internet access, security, and privacy. Read more about projects at my research group web page.

My research group publishes papers in top-tier networking, security, and machine learning/modeling conferences, and also regularly publish open-source software. An important value of our lab is real-world impact, through the deployment of operational systems. Contact me to learn more about the group, including how to join.
