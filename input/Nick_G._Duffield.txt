Previous Research Areas
Data Analytics and Mobility Modeling in Cellular Networks
Machine Learning in Network Management: Exploring the complex causal relationships between measurable network behavior and customer experience
Optimal Sampling (including Smart Sampling of Flow Records): Developing efficient sampling algorithms that provably optimize trade-off between sample size and estimation variance, even for heavy-tailed distributions typical in the Internet. Structure aware sampling for more accurate range queries. Fair sampling over subpopulations. Versions currently deployed in network measurement infrastructure.
Architectures for Fine Grained Traffic Measurement: Router level data structures for storage and retrieval of delay measurements. Enhancing performance measurement through temporal locality,
Graph Sampling: unbiased node sampliing in P2P networks.
Network Security and Attack Detection: stress testing traffic, machine learning of flow classifiers
Performance Monitoring. Sampling for temporal loss patterns, now standardized in the IETF.
Trajectory Sampling. Coordinate packet sampling across routers based on hash of invariant packet fields. Now standardized in the IETF.
Network Tomography.
Traffic Matrices: inferring traffic matrices from link level traffic aggregates. Deployed in network measurement infrastructure.
Link Performance: inferring link level loss and delay by correlating end-to-end measurements across a mesh of paths. Support for reporting by transport protocols standardized in the IETF.
The Hose Model for Virtual Private Networks: service without advance need of a traffic matrix
Network Measurement Infrastructure: early generation (T3 speed) passive monitors
Analysis and Measurement of Effective Bandwidths: using
Large Deviations and Martingale methods to establish generic bounds on queue tail probabilities, without the need for a detailed traffic model.
Admission Control using measured effective bandwidth.
Statistical Mechanics
Quantum dynamical semigroups and mean-field theory
Large deviations and group representations
Non-equilibrium phase transitions
