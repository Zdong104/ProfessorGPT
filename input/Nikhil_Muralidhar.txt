Research
Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.

At Stevens, I lead the ScAI (Scientific Artificial Intelligence) Lab. The primary research focus at ScAI lab entails developing machine learning models that also incorporate scientific knowledge (along with data) governing a process of interest. This area of research is termed Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML).

Our group at ScAI lab is especially focused on leveraging scientific domain knowledge to improve model generalization, decision interpretability and reduce the negative effects of data paucity and noise. Most recently, we have been focused on leveraging machine learning techniques to address challenges in physics (specifically computational fluid dynamics) to alleviate the cost of expensive simulations using science-guided machine learning models.

Other areas of research interest include:
1. Transfer Learning & Domain Adaptation
2. Multi-task & Meta Learning
3. Time-series Forecasting & Anomaly Detection (especially in the context of Cyber-Physical Systems)
4. Intelligent Disaster Management
5. Disease Modeling (COVID-19, Influenza-Like-illnesses)
General Information
I completed my Ph.D (Aug. 22') from the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech advised by Prof. Naren Ramakrishnan and Prof. Anuj Karpatne. Prior to my Ph.D., I was part of the Big Data and Personalization team at The Washington Post and was primarily focused on developing and maintaining news article recommendation systems and online content optimization tools using multi-armed bandits.
