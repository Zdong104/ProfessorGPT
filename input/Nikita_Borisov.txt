Research Statement

My research interests lie in the area of computer security and privacy, especially as applied to large-scale distributed systems. My current focus is on anonymity: analysis of existing anonymous systems and the design of new peer-to-peer anonymous networks. In this research I take a systems approach, with rigorous, quantitative metrics of anonymity and analysis with help from simulations. I also work on other privacy enhancing technologies, such as techniques for privacy-preserving data aggregation, as well as research into building reliable and secure peer-to-peer networks.

Research Interests
Fingerprinting of network traffic and endpoints
Privacy-preserving data sharing
Design and analysis of anonymous networks
Research Areas
Communication networks
Computer networking
Computer security, privacy, and information trust
