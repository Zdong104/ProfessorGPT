 CV [Feb. 2024],  Google Scholar

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at Texas A&M University. Previously, I was a postdoc in the CSE department at UC San Diego, where I worked with Ravi Ramamoorthi. I finished my Ph.D. in the ECE department at UC Santa Barbara under the supervision of Pradeep Sen.

Research Interests

My primary research interests are in computer graphics with an emphasis on computational photography and rendering. Specifically, in recent years, I have focused on developing machine learning techniques for image synthesis in these two fields. Overall, my goal is to develop practical systems in a variety of computational photography and rendering applications with the goal of representing the world around us accurately.
