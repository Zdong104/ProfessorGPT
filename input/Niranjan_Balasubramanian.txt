Brief Bio
Before joining Stony Brook, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Turing Center in the University of Washington, where I worked closely with the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by Prof. James Allan at the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR).
