NITESH SAXENA - PROFESSOR, COMPUTER SCIENCE; ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, GLOBAL CYBER RESEARCH INSTITUTE; DEAN'S RESEARCH FELLOW

 

Greetings! I am a Full Professor of the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Texas A&M University (A&M), the Associate Director of Texas A&M Global Cyber Research Institute (GCRI),  and a Dean’s Research Fellow at the College of Engineering & Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station. Broadly, I work in the areas of computer and network security, and applied cryptography. My particular focus is on fundamental, transformative, inter-disciplinary and game changing research, which can go beyond the traditional confines of academic domain and make a positive impact to the lives of end users hopefully relatively quickly.

My students and I run the SPIES — Security and Privacy In Emerging computing and networking Systems — research lab. Besides research, I have a major emphasis on workforce development, especially in areas related to cybersecurity. In this line, I am currently a co principal Investigator of the  TAMU CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program, funded by NSF. Previously, I was the principal investigator and director of the UAB CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS) program (2017-2021), and had served as the Co-Director of UAB’s M.S. program in Cyber-Security (2012-2021).  I also co-led UAB’s Center for Cyber Security (2018-2021), which is an NSA/DHS National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research (CAE-R).

My research has been externally supported by NSF (multiple grants and multiple programs, including SaTC, CICI and SFS), DOD, NSA, NIJ/DoJ, Google (2 Faculty Research Awards), Comcast, Cisco, Microsoft Research, MxD, Intel, Nokia, and Research in Motion.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science from UC Irvine. I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from UC Santa Barbara, and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India. Before joining A&M, I was on the faculty of the department of Computer Science at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and before then, I was on the faculty of the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering.

Note for Students:  I am actively looking for exceptionally bright prospective PhD/MS/BS students to join my research group. If interested, please contact me with your CV.
