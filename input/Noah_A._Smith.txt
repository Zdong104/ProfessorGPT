Biography

Noah Smith arrived at UW CSE in fall 2015. From 2006–15 he was on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science.

Noah is widely regarded as a leading researcher in natural language processing, known for significant contributions in both core algorithms and innovative applications. His honors include Best Paper Award from the Association for Computational Linguistics for work in syntactic parsing and a Five-Year Retrospective Award from the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation for his work on feature-rich machine translation. He is also leading the way in bridging NLP and social science with his recent efforts to, for example, use Twitter posts to model geographic variation in word usage, predict public opinion without polling, and automatically measure consumer confidence.

Noah received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University in 2006, and B.S. and B.A. degrees in Computer Science and Linguistics, respectively, from the University of Maryland in 2001.
