We are building a new breed of cameras with increased functionality and performance that will transform the way cameras are built in coming decades, from low-end consumer imagers to high-end scientific instruments. Our research is in the emerging field of computational photography, which combines expertise in optics, image processing, computer vision, and computer graphics. We design, model and build systems that combine sensors, displays, and novel optical elements. The Computational Photography Lab is led by Prof. Oliver Cossairt, Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Northwestern University.
