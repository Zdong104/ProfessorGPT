about

I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania leading the trustml@Penn research group. I am a member of the ASSET, PRECISE, and PRiML centers, and of PLClub. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. at Stanford advised by Alex Aiken, and spent a year as a postdoc at MIT working with Armando Solar-Lezama.



research

I am broadly interested in machine learning and programming languages research. Currently, my group is working on developing novel techniques for building systems that incorporate machine learning components, focusing on their correctness, programmability, and efficiency. We draw on techniques spanning learning theory, programming languages, formal methods, and control theory, and are interested in applications including robotics, healthcare, and software systems. Our research directions are detailed here.
