INTERESTS
Owen is interested in morphology, syntax (mainly), and semantics. He is interested in linguistic analyses, in formalisms that can be used to describe them, and in processing models.
BIOGRAPHY

Owen received a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania, and he has worked at AT&T Labs — Research, 15 years at Columbia University as a research scientist, and three years at Elemental Cognition LLC, a startup aiming to develop software for deep language understanding. At Columbia, he was part of the Center for Computational Learning Systems. He was co-founder of CADIM, a research group on Arabic natural language processing (NLP), which is licensing state-of-the-art robust NLP tools.

RESEARCH

Owen Rambow's research focuses on natural language processing and computational linguistics. Specific interests include both the “nuts and bolts” of language, such as morphology and syntax, and how language is actually used in context.
