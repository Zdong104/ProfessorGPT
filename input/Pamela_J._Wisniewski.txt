The Art and Science of Human-Computer Interaction

Dr. Pamela Wisniewski and her students at Vanderbilt University (and previously the University of Central Florida) examine the complex interactions between technology and people and how this interplay affects human behavior and society. Combining computer science, social science, and user-centered design principles, the STIR Lab leverages interdisciplinary approaches to deeply understand users, their needs, and the technologies that can be designed to best meet those needs.

**The STIR Lab is committed to supporting underrepresented minorities and women in STEM. If you are interested in joining our lab, contact Dr. Wisniewski.**
