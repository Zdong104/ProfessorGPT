I am an assistant professor at Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Auburn University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida. I received B.E. degree from Department of Software Engineering, Sichuan University in June, 2015. From 2014-2016, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Multimedia Lab, Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong (MMLab, CUHK) and Multimedia Research Center, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (MMLab, SIAT).

I am interested in developing the essential AI techniques and seamlessly integrating them for creating or empowering real-time downstream applications in next-generation infrastructure systems.

Openings: I am currently searching for highly-talented students (PhDs, Masters, and Undergraduates) to work or remotely work with me. More details click.
