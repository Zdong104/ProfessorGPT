Parinaz Naghizadeh

Assistant Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering


Network economics, game theory, ethics and economics of AI, optimization, reinforcement learning, economics of cyber security

Professor Naghizadeh and her group develop mathematical models and analytical tools to predict and influence how humans and/or algorithmic decision makers behave in complex network environments. Specifically, their current work focuses on the ethics and economics in AI (including long-term impacts of human-in-the-loop, and data biases), decision making and learning in networks (multilayer network games, and multi-agent reinforcement learning), and the economics of cyber security (using incentive design and data analytics to improve security decision making).
