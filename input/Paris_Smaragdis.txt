I’m a professor and associate head in the CS department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (and an affiliate professor in ECE).  My primary research interests revolve around making machines that can listen. I’ve done plenty of work on signal processing, machine learning and statistics as they relate to artificial perception, and in particular computational audition. I also love working on anything related to audio! The bulk of my work on audio is on source separation, and various novel machine learning approaches for traditional signal processing problems.  I also helped create and manage the CS side of the CS+Music program.

I am fortunate to have been associated with some amazing research labs. I completed my masters, Ph.D. and a postdoc at the Machine Listening Group at the MIT Media Lab under the supervision of Barry Vercoe. I currently work with AWS as an Amazon Scholar, previously I started Adobe Research's audio research, before that I was at MERL, and have spent some time at Interval Research and Starlab. I was also a visiting scientist at MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research. In 2006 I was selected by MIT’s Technology Review as one of the year’s top young technology innovators. I'm an IEEE fellow, was an IEEE Distinguished Lecturer for 2016-2017, and I am the Editor-in-Chief for the ACM/IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing. I've previously chaired the IEEE SPS Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing Technical Committee, the IEEE SPS Machine Learning for Signal Processing Technical Committee, the IEEE SPS Data Science Initiative, and I've served in the IEEE SPS Board of Governors.

I’m a descendant of a long music academic lineage dating to the early 1600s. My Erdös number is 4. You can get my academic stats here, and some of my (US) patents here.  If you are curious, here's my CV.
