I am Patrick McDaniel, the Tsun-Ming Shih Professor of Computer Sciences in the School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a fellow of IEEE, ACM, and the AAAS. I work closely with a number of faculty doing research in various areas of security, systems, and policy, principally with the faculty of the MadS&P (UW-Madison Security and Privacy) security group of which I am a part.

My professional life is devoted to the pursuit of novel research in a broad array of areas of computer science (see below). As part of that pursuit I am fortunate to advise a number of exceptionally talented and committed graduate students and post-docs, as well as participate in many rewarding professional service activities. This website documents many of these activities, but is not even close to exhaustive. If there is something you wish to know or want more detail on information that is here, feel free to contact me directly.

The pages linked from the menu at the left cover broadly my research, teaching, and personal activities. Those wishing to speak to me in a professional capacity should contact me via email. Email is probably the most reliable way of contacting him (warning, responses may take a couple of days due to travel and other factors).
