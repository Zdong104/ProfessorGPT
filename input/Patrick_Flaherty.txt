Flaherty Lab

Foundations of Data Science for Molecular Biology and Genetics

About

Our lab develops novel statistical methodology for genomic data to understand fundamental biological mechanisms and improve the treatment of complex human diseases.

Goals

Our long-term goal is to enhance the utility of genomic data for basic science and clinical decision-making to improve human health.

Approach

We adapt and improve methods from statistics, computer science, and genetics.
