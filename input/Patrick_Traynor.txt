Patrick G Traynor

John and Mary Lou Dasburg Preeminent Chair in Engineering

I am a Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) at the University of Florida, where I co-direct the Florida Institute for Cybersecurity (FICS) Research.

I am committed to the real-world impact of my research, and have co-founded three start-up companies (Skim Reaper, CryptoDrop and Pindrop Security). My team and I have also uncovered critical vulnerabilities in cellular networks, made the first measurement of mobile malware infections and offers robust mechanisms for combatting Caller-ID scams.

I received a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation in 2010, was named a Sloan Fellow in 2014, a Fellow for the Center for Financial Inclusion at Accion in 2016 and a Kavli Fellow in 2017.
