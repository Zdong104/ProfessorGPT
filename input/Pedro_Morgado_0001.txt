I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and affiliated with the Computer Sciences department. My research interests are at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, I develop systems that continuously learn to perceive the world through multiple sensory modalities.

Previously, I was a postdoc researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Abhinav Gupta. I completed my PhD at the University of California San Diego advised by Nuno Vasconcelos, and both BSc and MSc degrees at Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, where I worked with Margarida Silveira and Jorge S Marques.
