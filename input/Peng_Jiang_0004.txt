About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Iowa. My research interests generally lie in the areas of high-performance computing, systems, and machine learning. I received the NSF CAREER Award for research in compiler and runtime support for data-intensive applications on heterogeneous hardware.

I earned my Ph.D. from the Ohio State University under the supervision of Dr. Gagan Agrawal. I received an M.S. in Computer Science from the Chinese Academy of Science and a B.S. from Xidian University, Xi’an, China.
