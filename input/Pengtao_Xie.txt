I obtained my PhD from the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests mainly lie in machine learning inspired by humans' learning skills (especially classroom learning skills), such as learning by self explanation, small-group learning, learning by teaching, etc., and their applications in Large Language Models, Foundation Models, and  Healthcare. Here is a summary of research outcome.
