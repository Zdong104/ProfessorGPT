Vitae

Below is my brief "hypelinked" vitae. And here is my CV in PDF format.

Graduated with honor (1983) from the Moscow State University (Applied Mathematics). PhD from the Moscow State University, 1987 (Computer Science, advisor Prof. Lev Korolev). Junior and Senior Research Scientist in All-Union Scientific and Technical Information Center (1987 to 1990). Senior Research Scientist in International Centre for Scientific and Technical Information (1990-1994). Lecturer and student advisor at School of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics of the Moscow State University (1987-1994). Visiting researcher at the University of Sussex, School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, UK (1993). Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the Cognition and Communication Group, Department of Psychology, University of Trier, Germany (1994-1996). Visiting Research Scientist at School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University (1996-1998). My reseach work with John Anderson was suppoprted by a grant from James S. McDonnell Foundation. Director of Computer-Managed Instruction at Carnegie Technology Education (later iCarnegie), a wholly owned, non-profit subsidiary of Carnegie Mellon University (1998-1999).

In 2000 I joined the University of Pittsburgh as an Assistant Professor at School of Information Sciences (SIS). I am currently a Professor and the head of Personalized and Adaptive Systems Lab in the School of Computing and Information, the successor of SIS. I have secondary appointments at Intelligent Systems Program, University of Pittsburgh and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I also served as a Fulbright-Nokia Distinguished Chair at the Aalto University and University of Helsinki (2013-2014), E.T.S Walton Visiting Professor at National College of Ireland, Visiting Professor at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (2002), and Visiting Assistant Professor at the Tokio Denki University, Japan (1993). In addition to my degrees from the Moscow State University, I also hold a Doctor Honoris Causa degree from the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (2009).
