Note for Prospective Students:
The graduate admissions process is handled by a departmental committee, not by individual faculty. You can find information about the process in Statistics here and in Computer Science here. I am unable to supervise summer interns. I apologize in advance for not responding to the email that I receive about graduate admission and about summer internships.
