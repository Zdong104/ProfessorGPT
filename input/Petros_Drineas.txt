Links: Wikipedia, Google Scholar, short bio, full CV.

Chcek out this great introductory video and blog for RandNLA by DJ Rich of TrueTheta.

Randomization in Numerical Linear Algebra made a cameo appearance in Netflix's hit series 'The Lincoln Lawyer'!  Watch this short clip from Season 1, Episode 3 (disclaimer). Michael Mahoney and I coined this term in late 2011 and the first workshop on Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) was held during FOCS 2012 (check the Nuit Blanche and My Biased Coin blog posts for details).
