I study ways to ensure the safety of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, with emphases on ensuring the safety and fairness of machine learning (ML) algorithms and on creating safe and practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. I am the director of the Autonomous Learning Lab (ALL) at UMass (2017–present).

Previously I worked as a postdoc for Emma Brunskill at CMU. I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at UMass in 2015, where Andrew Barto was my adviser. I completed my B.S. and M.S. in computer science at CWRU in 2008 and 2009, where Michael Branicky was my adviser. Before that, in high school, I was introduced to computer science and mentored by David Kosbie.

Collaborations / Working Together

I may recruit one doctoral student for Fall 2025. If so, I will be looking for students interested in exploring the intersection of reinforcement learning and philosophy of mind. Application instructions to the doctoral program can be found here. I am not working with additional undergraduate or masters students at this time (this includes research projects, independent studies, internships, and volunteerships).
