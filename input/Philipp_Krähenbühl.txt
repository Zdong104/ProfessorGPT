Research

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I received my PhD in 2014 from the CS Department at Stanford University and then spent two wonderful years as a PostDoc at UC Berkeley.

My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Machine learning and Computer Graphics. I’m particularly interested in deep learning, image, video and scene understanding.

Joining my research group

UT CS or ECE students: I’d recomment you to take my graduate deep learning class (CS395T), and start working with me through that class.

Prospective students: Please read about our graduate admissions process and state your interested in my research group in your statement of purpose. Please do not contact me directly. The statistics are not in your favor either. We have not yet admitted a single student to UTCS who contacted me directly.

About my last name

I’m well aware that my last name is not the easiest one to write or cite (and I saw it butchered a bunch of times over the years). So to make things easier just pick your document type below and copy the string:

Regular text

Krähenbühl


Latex & Bibtex

Kr\"ahenb\"uhl


HTML

Kr&auml;henb&uuml;hl


If all the above fail, just use Kraehenbuehl.
