Phil Gibbons is a Professor in the Computer Science Department and the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1989. Gibbons was a researcher in the Mathematical Sciences Research Center at AT&T Bell Laboratories (1990-1996), the Information Sciences Research Center at Lucent Bell Laboratories (1996-2001), and the Intel Research Pittsburgh Lablet (2001-2011). He was Co-PI/Co-Director for the $15M Intel Science and Technology Center for Cloud Computing (2011-2015). Gibbons' research areas include big data, parallel computing, databases, cloud computing, sensor networks, distributed systems and computer architecture. His publications span theory and systems, across a broad range of computer science and engineering (e.g., conference papers in ATC, ESA, EuroSys, HPCA, IPDPS, ISCA, MICRO, NeurIPS, NSDI, OSDI, PACT, SoCC, SODA, SOSP and SPAA since 2015).
