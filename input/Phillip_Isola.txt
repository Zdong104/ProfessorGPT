About me

I am an associate professor in EECS at MIT studying computer vision, machine learning, and AI.

Previously, I spent a year as a visiting research scientist at OpenAI, and before that I was a postdoctoral scholar with Alyosha Efros in the EECS department at UC Berkeley. I completed my Ph.D. in Brain & Cognitive Sciences at MIT, under the supervision of Ted Adelson, where I also frequently worked with Aude Oliva. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Yale, where I got my start on research working with Brian Scholl. A longer bio is here.

Our computer vision textbook is finished!

Lots of things have happened since we started thinking about this book in November 2010; yes, it has taken us more than 10 years to write this book. Our initial goal was to write a large book that provided a good coverage of the field. Unfortunately, the field of computer vision is just too large for that. So, we decided to write a small book instead, limiting each chapter to no more than five pages. Writing a short book was perfect because we did not have time to write a long book and you did not have time to read it. Unfortunately, we have failed at that goal, too. This book covers foundational topics within computer vision, with an image processing and machine learning perspective. The audience is undergraduate and graduate students who are entering the field, but we hope experienced practitioners will find the book valuable as well.

Research Group
The goal of our group is to scientifically understand intelligence. We are especially interested in human-like intelligence, i.e. intelligence that is built out of deep nets, is highly adaptive and general-purpose, and is emergent from embodied interactions in rich ecosystems.

Questions we are studying include the following, which you can click on to expand:



▸ Science of deep learning: Why do large models find solutions that generalize? What structures improve generalization? And when might these methods still fail?

Representative projects: Low-rank bias, Quasimetric learning, What makes for good views for contrastive learning

▸ Emergent intelligence: How can intelligence emerge from data and tasks, and how can it emerge without imitating another intelligence's cultural artifacts?

Representative projects: Neural MMO, PowderWorld

▸ Embodied intelligence: To what extent is physical embodiment, in interactive environments, useful or necessary for intelligence?

Representative projects: Embodied representation learning, Mental imagery for robots

▸ Synthetic data and environments: What kinds of training data / environments are most instructive toward achieving robust, aligned, and general intelligence?

Representative projects: Generative data, Procedural data, NeRF data

▸ Controllable AI: How can we make AI systems that can be steered, edited, and controlled by human users?

Representative projects: Visual prompting, GAN steering, Totems


Our goal in studying these questions is to help equip the world with the tools necessary to bring about a positive integration of AI into society; to understand intelligence so we can prevent its harms and to reap its benefits.

The lab is part of the broader Embodied Intelligence and Visual Computing research communities at MIT.
