Community, opportunity, support
Undergraduate research
Undergrad research is great way to tap directly into our professors’ expertise. Best of all, we don’t just allow our undergrads to participate in research—we encourage it.
Student orgs
Connect, compete, network, learn, lead, volunteer, grow and more. Joining student orgs (but maybe not all 50 of them) gives you even more power to personalize your college experience.
Wellness
We offer a well-rounded, collaborative approach to your well-being so that you can thrive. That means people and services to help you keep your academic, physical, emotional and mental health on track.
Career services
As an engineer, you get the best of both worlds: It’s a really fun major. It’s also a career that’s in super-high demand. In other words, your job outlook both during and after college is pretty rosy.
Inclusion, equity and diversity

A strong community is one in which each member encourages and supports the others. In our college, that’s what we strive to do, so that you can reach your full potential.
