RESEARCH AREAS AND THRUSTS
My research group Polo Club of Data Science innovates at the intersection of machine learning and visualization to synthesize scalable, interactive, and trustworthy tools that amplify human’s ability to understand and interact with billion-scale data and machine learning models. Our research thrusts include: human-centered AI (interpretable, safe, fair AI; adversarial ML), large graph visualization and mining, cybersecurity and social good. See all our projects at our group website. Some highlights:
Inclusive AI for Everyone: Diffusion Explainer (went viral) and CNN Explainer helps beginners learn deep learning models (went viral; invited to SIGGRAPH), Dodrio compares NLP attention mechanisms with linguistic knowledge, GAN Lab visualizes how generative adversarial network (GAN) works (went viral; with Google), ActiVis enables visual exploration of industry-scale deep neural networks (deployed on Meta's ML platform used by 25% engineers; invited to SIGGRAPH), ManimML (IEEE VIS Best Poster; went viral) communicates ML architectures with animation, Communicating with Interactive Articles examines interactive article design by synthesizing theory from education, journalism, and visualization.

Scalable Visual Discovery for Trustworthy and Interpretable AI: Summit and NeuroCartography scalably summarize and visualize learned concepts, Bluff pinpoints model vulnerabilities, FairVis visually discovers ML bias, Recast audits toxicity detection models, comprehensive survey on visual analytics for deep learning (best for practitioners and new researchers), industry human-AI guidelines comparision.

Protecting AI models: ShapeShifter the first targeted physical attack (highlighted by DARPA as state-of-the-art; with Intel), SHIELD fast and practical defense (KDD Audience Appreciation Award, Runner-up), SkeletonVis reveals temporal and spatial incoherence of attacks, UnMask protects deep learning through robust feature alignment, robust accented speech recognition (with Amazon AWS AI), REST for robust sleep monitoring, ADAGIO for audio defense.

Novel datasets and tools: TIGER for evaluating graph robustness (part of Nvidia Data Science teaching kit), MalNet the largest graph- and image-based security datasets, PEGASUS billion-scale graph mining (Open Source Software World Challenge, Silver Award).

Social good (education, health, human trafficking): Firebird for fire risk prediction (KDD Best Student Paper, Runner-up; with Atlanta Fire Rescue Department), Chronodes for mobile health visual data exploration (ACM TiiS Best Paper, Honorable Mention), CardiacAR for mixed-reality heart surgical planing (with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta), augmented coding (Best Poster, Chinese CHI), mixed-reality for learning programming (IDC Best Work-in-Progress, Honorable Mention), TrafficVis fights human trafficking (VIS Best Poster, Honorable Mention), Argo Scholar for literature exploration in browsers (VIS Best Poster, Honorable Mention), extends Argo Lite, Autograding of D3 visualizations (VIS Best Poster), EnergyVis explores ML model energy consumption, PeopleMap (VIS Best Poster, Honorable Mention), Magic Crop (auto-magically cropping headshot photos)

Cybersecurity & fraud detection: Polonium and Aesop malware detection over 37 billion machine-file relationships (patented and deployed by Symantec; protects 120 million people), Marco (SDM Best Student Paper), NetProbe eBay auction fraud detection (covered by WSJ, USA Today, Washington Post, LA Times, etc.), LatentGesture mobile authentication via touch signatures (covered by Wired, Engadget, Gizmodo, Yahoo News, Atlanta Business Chronicle, etc.), D2M detects adversarial movements in networks (with Microsoft), insider trading pattern discovery (with Securities and Exchange Commission), FairPlay (fraud and malware detection on Google Play).
