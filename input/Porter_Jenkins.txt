Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at Brigham Young University. I completed my PhD student at Penn State University studying machine learning and data mining under the supervision of Jessie Li . I graduated from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics.

Research Interests
My current research interest lies in real-world artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, my research studies physical perception [WACV'23], tasks plagued by small data [AAAI'22, IJCAI'21, CIKM'19, GeoSim'21], and problems where the cost of an error made by an AI system is high [AAAI’24]. The latter typically involves uncertainty quantification of some kind. Additionally, I have studied important problems in recommender systems [AAAI'21, WWW'20].
Teaching Interests
I currently teach CS 180: Introduction to Data Science, CS 452: Database Concepts, and CS677: Bayesian Methods in Computer Science.
