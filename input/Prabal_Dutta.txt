Active Research Themes

IoT Connectivity. The "Internet of Things" promises to bring a trillion smart and connected devices online over the next decade or two. A major question is how so many of these devices will connected to the Internet beyond today's options, especially on tight power budgets, in remote locations, and away from the device owners. We are exploring privacy-first opportunistic communications via smartphones with Galaxy and Nebula, new beyond-backscatter transceivers, and drones and smallsats.

Embedded Device Generation. Motivated by the difficulty of designing embedded systems and the progress of high-level synthesis and generative AI, this project explores a simple idea: that the software that runs on an embedded system could be used, with some annotations, as the specification for the required hardware platform, as well as for its automatic synthesis.

PowerBlade. The project's goal is to establish the first comprehensive understanding of the growth and nature of miscellaneous electrical loads, which are expected to dominate end-use energy consumption in the near future, with the aim of informing Federal and State policy. This project builds on our prior work on the PowerBlade sensor, the world's smallest true-power AC plug-load meter. We plans to deploy between 10,000-20,000 plug-load meters in 200-500 US homes.

Embedded Operating Systems. Tock is a new OS designed to run multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on the low-memory and low-power microcontrollers common in embedded systems. It pioneered the Rust language for operating system design and it has been adopted by startups and major corporations alike.

Completed Research Projects

IoT/Swarm. The Internet of Things will bring a trillion new wireless, embedded Internet hosts online within a decade or two. Many of these devices will be highly constrained in their energy, connectivity, and computational capacity, raising new research questions about how to build secure applications that span the embedded, mobile/gateway, and cloud platforms. We're exploring the IoT design space, from system architecture directions for the Swarm to circuits and systems with a focus on modular design of ultralow-power components to application runtimes for the IoT to Internet and application layer gateways to IoT services like localization. Our goal is to research how we should build devices and software that survive and thrive in this not-too-distant future.

M3. The goal of the Michigan Micro Mote (M3) project is to finally realize the Smart Dust vision: networks of integrated, autonomous, energy-harvesting nodes that can sense the environment and deliver their data over a wireless mesh network. The concrete goal of the project is to: (1) create sensor nodes that are cubic-mm in size, (2) draw ~10 nW, and (3) deliver data every few seconds or minutes. This requires advances in every layer of the system stack -- circuits to memory to processor to timers to radios to interconnects to packaging to software to protocols to programming models. If successful, this represents a 1,000-10,000 fold improvement over the state-of-the-art in size and power, compared with circa 2010 systems. CubeWorks is commercializing this technology.

Energy and Water Metering. 
Federal sustainability goals mandate that 50% of U.S. commercial buildings become net-zero energy by 2050. A range of options exists to achieve this goal, but financial concerns require a data-driven, empirically-validated approach. However, critical gaps exist in the measurement technology, and indoor climate control science, needed to benchmark competing options, prioritize efficiency investments, and ensure occupant comfort. To address these challenges, we are researching a range of scalable resource metering and monitoring techniques, from plug-load metering to non-intrusive load monitoring. One recent thrust includes Monjolo (a "peel-and-stick" sensor that can be affixed to everyday objects, like a ceiling light, shower head, or range top, to infer their contributions to whole-building resource consumption). The sensors monitor the ambient conditions around a load and, using statistical methods, correlate those conditions with readings from existing electricity, gas, or water meters, providing individual estimates without intrusive metering. The key insight is that the transfer and use of energy (and other resources) usually emits energy, often in a different domain, and that this emitted energy is often enough to intermittently power simple, energy harvesting sensors whose duty cycle is proportional to the energy being transferred or used.

Localization. Accurately locating people, places, and things, particularly in indoor settings, will enable a variety of new applications and services. We are exploring a number of fronts in this space:

(i) The Harmonia/Harmonium project is exploring the design space of localizing and tracking fast-moving aerial objects in indoor settings using RF time-of-arrival techniques. Our recent results show that it is possible to precisely track tiny airborne drones with a small (1.5 cc), lightweight (3 g), and low power (75 mW) system using a novel ultrawideband (UWB) transmitter and receiver design that support fast updates (19-56 Hz) and inexpensive tags ($4.50). Our first design mixes a square wave and sine wave to generate a wideband signal (the Fourier coefficients) and recovers them using a bandstitching receiver that uses a frequency-stepped, narrowband radio to reconstruct the wideband signal [HotWireless'14], reprinted [MC2R'14]. Harmonium, a subsequent design, works through walls and in the presence of narrowband interferers that knock out commercial UWB ranging systems [IPSN'16]. Harmonium employs novel ultrawideband pulse generators that occupy several GHz of bandwidth and provide positioning accuracy to the decimeter-level. This bandstitched receiver design allows multi-GHz resolution with the cost of narrowband FM receivers.

(ii) The PolyPoint/SurePoint system is exploring the performance of 2-way RF Time-of-Flight (ToF) ranging-based localization systems that use IEEE 802.15.4-compliant UWB timing operations (based on the DecaWave DW1000 chip). The PolyPoint node hardware augments this chip with a 3-way RF switch connected to three antennas to provide antenna diversity and reduce the effects of RF polarization. An Atum module (with ARM Cortex-M3) schedules ranging operations and calculates the range estimates, which are then offloaded for trilateration processing. The ranging operations are repeated 27 times: (3 tag antennas)×(3 anchor antennas)×(3 UWB channels) [HotWireless'15, where it won the "Potential for Test of Time 2025 Award"]. PolyPoint placed 3rd in the infrastructure-based category and 4th overall at the 2015 Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition [IPSN'15]. SurePoint extends this work to improve ranging accuracy and ranging network formation speed while also introducing UWB constructive interference [SenSys'16]. SurePoint has been used to demonstrate a new method for calibration-free, infrastructure- free localization in sensor networks [IPSN'17].

(iii) The Luxapose project is exploring the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires. The luminaires, modified to allow rapid, on-off keying, transmit their identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical pulses. A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image, decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires. The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be solved with optimization techniques, yielding accurate indoor positioning: 10 cm position error and 10 degree heading error at the 90th percentile [MobiCom'14]. Luxapose is one of the applications that run on software-defined lighting [VLCS'14].

(iv) The Opo Project seeks to capture the nature of face-to-face human interactions in natural settings with high spatial and temporal fidelity. This information allows us understand real-world social dynamics and their implications on epidemiology, informal informational networks, and childhood social development. Key to enabling this work is an ultralow-power system that can detect face-to-face interactions on a sub-milliwatt power budget using a new ultrasonic wakeup radio that can be built from commodity components. With very low power draw, sensor nodes can be miniaturized to the point that they are the size of a large lapel pin, yet keep a lifetime of over a week with a Chiclet-sized battery. Data collected using recent versions of this system are recovered using Bluetooth Low Energy and a smart phone hosted gateway application [SenSys'14].

HiJack. HiJack is a hardware/software platform for creating cubic-inch sensor peripherals for the mobile phone. HiJack devices harvest power and steal bandwidth from the mobile phone's headset interface. Several energy harvesting power supply designs are possible, with tradeoffs in efficiency, cost, and complexity. Our initial design coupled a Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller with an iPhone 3G/3GS/4G, iPod Touch, or iPad [DEV'10]. This design won the ISLPED low power design contest in 2010 [ISLPED'10] and was distributed by Seeed Studio to academic, industrial, and hobbyist users in over 50 countries and on 6 continents. EnergyMicro (now SiLabs) ported the design to their Tiny Gecko [AN0054]. NXP Semiconductor ported HiJack to their LPC800 family, continuing support for iOS and adding support for Android (Samsung Galaxy S3). NXP markets their version as Quick-Jack [OM13069], which is available through Digi-Key, Mouser, Newark, Farnell, and others. We have also explored an alternate design point, called AudioDAQ, that uses the microphone bias voltage to supply low-power sensors like EKG, and uses the same mic line to provide a data path back into the phone, with some modulation of the analog signal to ensure it passes through the microphone's filters [SenSys'12]. The HiJack platform has enabled a new class of small and inexpensive phone-centric peripherals that support plug-and-play operation. At Michigan, HiJack has served as the basis for several low-power sensor and signal conditioning front-ends including EKG (3-lead and 2-hand), temperature, gas concentration (CO, NOx, O3, and SO2), and soil moisture, as well as an energy harvesting demonstration platform [XRDS'11]. HiJack has supported incentive-driven smoking cessation research [JNTR'14]. Outside of Michigan, HiJack has influenced or been directly used to detect HIV and syphilis biomarkers, enable health and wellness, measure and map radiation fields, and support mobile payment systems.

 


 

Low-Power Software Radio Architectures. "By about 2020 software radios will have become the standard technology for commercial, as well as military, radios, employed in a range of devices, from battery-powered sensors and hand-held devices to plugged-in devices (such as base stations)," claims BBN's Craig Partridge. However, one of the chief impediments to realizing this future is that today's software radios are large, expensive, and power-hungry, and so they're poorly-suited to battery-power and hand-held devices. This project explores clean-slate system architectures for software-defined radios, ranging from highly-programmble radios to RF front-ends with reconfigurable hardware baseband processing to simple RF front-ends with pure software baseband processing. Our chief aim is to make software radios small, inexpensive, and low-power. Today, we have an 802.15.4-compatible SDR platform that's just 3"x5" and costs around $100. The power figures are still not in. It will soon be an open platform for other researchers, and it will allow us to explore the range of architectural tradeoffs necessary to realize pervasive SDR systems.

Talking Book. ICT has the potential for deep social impact in developing regions but today's typical devices - laptops, mobile phones, and similar systems - are often still too expensive for many scenarios. The thesis of this work is that custom ICs can enable a new tier of low-cost information access devices with a price point that will make them widely accessible. And, with control over the silicon, these systems can economically address many other challenges. To evaluate these ideas, we focus on a deceptively simple problem - low-cost information access for illiterate populations through audio recordings - and explore how custom silicon allows us to reduce cost, lower power, leverage conventional infrastructure in unconventional ways, and optimize the interface for usability. In particular, we explore how a rural audio computer can be designed around just three chips, use an inexpensive capacitive touch interface, employ inductive communications for peer-to-peer data transfer, and employ content download over GSM voice and FM broadcast as two wide area options. The resulting design point -- enabled by aggressive silicon integration -- affords a device that can be built for less than $10. We are working with Literacy Bridge, a Washington state non-profit, to initially bring this technology to improve child and maternal health for 25,000 people across Ghana.
