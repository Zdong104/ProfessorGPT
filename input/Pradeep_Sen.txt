Welcome to my homepage! I run the UCSB MIRAGE Lab to research in computer graphics, imaging, visualization, and computer vision. I'm also the Director of the new UCSB Gaucho Game Lab, the video game development program at UC Santa Barbara. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Graphics Lab at Stanford University, where my adviser was Pat Hanrahan.

Professional Bio

Pradeep Sen is a Professor in the UCSB MIRAGE Lab in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He attended Purdue University from 1992 - 1996, where he graduated with a B.S. in Computer and Electrical Engineering. He then attended Stanford University where he received his M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 1998 in the area of electron-beam lithography. In 2000, he joined the Stanford Graphics Lab where he did research on real-time rendering and computational photography. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in June 2006, advised by Dr. Pat Hanrahan. His research interests include algorithms for image synthesis, computational image processing, and computational photography, and he is a co-author of over 50 technical publications, including more than ten SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia/ToG publications. Dr. Sen has been awarded more than $2.2 million in research funding, including an NSF CAREER award in 2009.

Personal Bio

Pradeep Sen was born in a small petroleum town in Northern Mexico and moved to Mexico City (Mexico D.F.) with his family when he was a young boy. He was raised in Mexico City until his family immigrated to the United States and settled in South Bend, IN. A proud Mexican-American, Dr. Sen is passionate about DEI and is involved in various activities on campus. He currently lives in Goleta, CA with his wife and two children.

Research Interests

My research interests are in the area of rendering/image synthesis and computational image processing. I study novel rendering algorithms to accelerate global illumination, as well as image-based techniques for capturing light transport. I am also interested in real-time rendering and graphics hardware. On the computational image processing side, I am interested in novel imaging architectures as well as new ways to combine processing and acquisition to capture new kinds of imagery.
