Research Interests
I am broadly interested in privacy-preserving and secure systems. My current interests include the domains of privacy enhancing technologies (such as anonymous communications, statistical data privacy), adversarial machine learning, and Internet/network security. My research draws on techniques from data science, network science/complex networks, distributed systems, and applied cryptography. Please see my publications page for more details.
