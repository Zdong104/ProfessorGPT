In Spring'24, I am also affiliated with the School of Math at the IAS.

Brief Bio: I got my PhD in CS from UT Austin in Summer 2016 with a dissertation on Strong Lower Bounds on Generic Convex Relaxations. I was a postdoctoral research instructor at the IAS and Princeton CS from 2016-19 and an Assistant Professor at CSD at CMU from 2019-2023.

Research Interests

Algorithms and computational thresholds for average-case computational problems, random matrices, extremal combinatorics
My work is generously supported by an NSF CAREER Award (2021), an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship (2022), a Google Research Scholar Award (2021), and an NSF Medium Grant for collaborative research with Venkat Guruswami (2022).

Research Highlights

Complete list of my papers. Some highlights/resources:

The Sum-of-Squares Method and Algorithm Design via Connections to Proof Complexity
Monograph on Semialgebraic Proofs and Efficient Algorithm Design.
Fall'21 CMU Lecture notes and videos.
Sum-of-Squares Framework for Efficient Robust Statistics
Resolving the robust learnability of mixtures of high-dimensional Gaussians (in the sequence [1], [2], and [3]) (see 2012 CACM Tech Perspective and Simons Research Vignette for history and context).
Toolkit for basic estimation: regression, moment estimation, and sparse recovery.
Efficient estimation in the presence of majority outliers (in the sequence [1], [2], and [3]).
Overview talk with open questions.
The Kikuchi Matrix Method and Applications
A new class of spectral methods for extremal combinatorics. Applications so far: refuting and solving smoothed SAT (CSPs), settling Feige's conjecture on extremal girth of hypergraphs, and improved lower bounds on locally decodable codes, and an exponential lower bound on three-query linear locally correctable codes.
Some recent talks.
Efficient Algorithms approaching the conjectured threshold for Semirandom and Smoothed Optimization
Refuting/solving Smoothed SAT and other CSPs(in the sequence [1], [2], [3]).
Finding planted cliques in Feige-Kilian Semirandom Model (see this book chapter and this paper for history and context on the question).
Breaking security of certain proposed cryptographic Pseudorandom Generators.
Some recent talks.
Pseudo-calibration, the Low-degree Polynomial Method and Sharp Computational Thresholds in Average-Case
Lower bounds for SoS SDPs via planted vs null distinguishing problems with applications to random CSPs, planted clique, Tensor/Sparse PCA, with new connections to spectral methods and the low degree polynomial heuristic for computational phase transitions in statistical estimation
Exponential lower bounds for linear relaxations for constraint satisfaction
Some talks.
