Biography

Predrag Radivojac’s primary research interests include computational biology and machine learning. He is motivated to improve our understanding of life at a molecular level and how molecular events affect higher level phenotypes. His group addresses these questions through the development of algorithms and analysis techniques related to the function of biological macromolecules, mass spectrometry proteomics, genome interpretation, and precision health.

Overall, he is interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of disease consequent to genetic variation. In the area of machine learning, his research addresses foundational and applied problems in semi-supervised learning, structured-output learning, and active learning, and investigates topics such as kernels and distance functions (e.g., metrics) across data types and analysis techniques. He is also interested in performance evaluation of machine learning algorithms, especially in the hierarchical structured-output domains and cases of selection bias that often arise in the open world setting.

Prior to joining Northeastern, Radivojac was a professor of computer science at Indiana University – Bloomington and the associate chair of the department. While there, he co-directed all of data sciences and informatics within the multi-campus Precision Health Initiative at Indiana University.

He received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2007. He is also an August-Wilhelm Scheer Visiting Professor at Technical University of Munich and an honorary member of the Institute for Advanced Study there.  He is currently an editorial board member for the journal Bioinformatics, associate editor for PLoS Computational Biology, and serving his third elected term on the Board of Directors for the International Society for Computational Biology.
