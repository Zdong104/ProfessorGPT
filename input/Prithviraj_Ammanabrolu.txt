Prithvirajâ€™s Home Score: 0

Welcome. You have arrived at the home of the Earth King (a.k.a. Prithviraj in Sanskrit). You see a plaque with an inscription below a picture of him at the door. What do you do?

>examine plaque

It reads:

â€œWell, hello there. I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego - leading the ðŸ§‹PEARLS LabðŸ§‹ in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I am currently not recruiting any students for my lab. More info can be found on my group website.

Iâ€™m also a research scientist at Mosaic AI in Databricks. My team is recruiting research scientists and engineers with strong RL/distributed systems experience. Please apply and drop a note to the right email.

I was previously on the Mosaic team in the Allen Institute for AI. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Mark Riedl as a research assistant at the Entertainment Intelligence Lab.

My CV is found here, my list of publication here, and projects here.

I am motivated by the question of how to imbue learning agents with the ability to understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. This work lies primarily at the intersection of Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing. The core theme of my research involves creating trustworthy and responsible language-based AI agents that are able to: (1) interactively gather and align to human preferences via feedback; and (2) build and use neurosymbolic world models that guide the agentâ€™s actions in grounded environments.

Your score has gone up by 10 points. You open the door and proceed into the house.
