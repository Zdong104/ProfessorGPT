Pubali Datta
Assistant Professor
University of Massachusetts Amherst
Welcome!

I am looking for Ph.D. students to join my research group. Please reach out if you are interested in working together!

I am an assistant professor in the Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences (CICS) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

My research interest is in securing emerging computing platforms. Modern computing systems are constantly growing in size and complexity, and layers of abstraction have helped us design these systems. However, as core design primitives are obscured, these indirections can also engender new security challenges. My research looks past these abstractions to study the core functionalities of modern computing systems. Through identifying the security and privacy challenges within these systems, I am able design mechanisms that prevent security violations while meeting the design and operational requirements of system users. I primarily work in the areas of Emerging Cloud Architectures, Internet of Things, and Threat Intelligence. My research detects, deters and investigates security attacks within large complex systems through the means of access control, information flow analysis, and auditing.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Adam Bates and I worked as a part of The Secure & Transparent Systems Laboratory. My dissertation is on securing serverless computing platforms through information flow analysis. Learn more about my research here.
