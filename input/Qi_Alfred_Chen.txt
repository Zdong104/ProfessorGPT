Introduction

 

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science (CS) at the University of California, Irvine. I am also affiliated with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Irvine (ITS-Irvine), the Center for Embedded and Cyber-physical Systems (CECS), the Institute for Software Research (ISR), and the UC Irvine Cybersecurity Policy & Research Institute (CPRI). Before coming to UCI, I received my Ph.D. degree from Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2018.

My research interest broadly lies in the security and privacy of computer technologies that are of high criticality to our daily life and society. So far, my focus has been mainly on the security/privacy issues in emerging AI/systems/network technologies, especially the latest ones with high societal impacts such as those powering the emerging AI-enabled autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems.

The major theme of my research is to proactively address security challenges through systematic problem analysis and design, leveraging techniques such as optimization, static/dynamic program analysis, formal methods, defense principles, and data-driven methods. My research has developed such approaches to systematically discover, analyze, detect, and fix security vulnerabilities in a wide range of important computer systems and components such as the AI/software stack in emering autonomous cars/drones/robots, intelligent traffic light, smartphone systems, critical network protocols (e.g., TCP), DNS, GUI systems, access control systems, etc.

Current Students: Takami Sato (Ph.D.), Ningfei Wang (Ph.D.), Ziwen Wan (Ph.D.), Fayzah Alshammari (Ph.D.), Shaoyuan Xie (Ph.D.), Justin Yue (B.S.), Sam Der (B.S.), Wentao Chen (B.S.), Chi Zhang (B.S.), Rong Mu (B.S.).

Alumni: Junjie Shen (Ph.D., first job at Meta), Kanglan Tang (B.S., now at UC Berkeley), Christopher Joseph Dipalma (B.S., now at Intel), Newman Cheng (B.S., now at Columbia), Kyle Bartz (B.S., now at Amazon), Zeyuan Chen (B.S., now at CMU), Nanze Chen (B.S., now at U of Cambridge), Han Wang (B.S., now at UPenn), Chen Wang (B.S., now at UC Berkeley).
