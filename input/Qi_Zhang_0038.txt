I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Carolina, USA. Before the current appointment that started from August 2020, I obtained my PhD degree in 2020 from the Computer Science and Engineering division at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and my BEng degree in 2015 from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests lie in artificial intelligence, with a special focus on cooperative artificial intelligence, which equips a group of sequential decision makers, or autonomous agents, with the capability of maximizing their joint utility. My long-term career goal is to improve the efficiency of solutions to cooperative AI by exploiting structural properties inherent in these problems. To achieve this goal, I have been developing expertise in the formalisms, theories, and algorithms of single- and multi-agent planning and reinforcement learning, as well as their applications to domains such as intelligent transportation systems, computational materials science, and clinical natural language processing.
