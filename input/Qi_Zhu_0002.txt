Research
My research interests include design automation of intelligent cyber-physical systems and Internet-of-Things applications, cyber-physical security, energy-efficient CPS, and system-on-chip design.

Recent work in my group has been focusing on system level synthesis, optimization and modeling methodologies for cyber-physical systems. We are particularly interested in addressing timing, heterogeneity, security and energy challenges in CPS design and operation. Below is a short summary and you may check our lab website for more up-do-date information: IDEAS - Design Automation of Intelligent Systems Lab.

Model-based and contract-based software synthesis of CPS [C44, C43, C38, C33, C28, C23, C22, C20, C17, C16, C14, C10, C9, C6, C5, CWIP1, J15, J7, J6, J5]
This work aims at generating efficient and correct software implementations for cyber-physical systems. We have developed algorithms for multi-task implementations of synchronous finite state machines [C10] and of synchronous block diagrams [C23, C16]; for task allocation and scheduling on multi-core and distributed platforms with respect to extensibility [C38], latency [C33, C6, J5], memory usage [C22, C9, J6], reliability [C20] and soft error tolerance [C28]; for optimizing task activation periods [J15, C5, CWIP1]; and for implementing synchronous models on LTTA platforms [J7].

Cross-layer design for cyber-physical systems security [C45, C42, C39, C35, C32, C26, C19, C12, J19, J13, J12, J10, J9, J8]
This work aims at building secure and efficient cyber-physical systems, which faces many unique challenges from the fast increase of system scale and complexity, the diversity of physical and cyber attack interfaces, the employment of distributed architectural platforms, and the often tight real-time and resource constraints. We are working on a cross-layer methodology that combines control-theoretic methods at the functional layer and cybersecurity techniques at the embedded platform layer, with applications in vehicles and vehicular networks [C42, C39, C35, C26, J12, J9]. We have also developed algorithms for security-aware task mapping in CAN-based systems and TDMA-based systems [C19, C12, J10, J8].
Design and management of energy-efficient buildings [C41, C37, C36, C31, C30, C29, C27, C21, C15, C11, C8, J18, J14, J11, J3]
To reduce energy consumption, modern green buildings employ complex automation systems that closely monitor and control the building environment (e.g. HVAC and lighting control). We have developed methodologies for co-designing HVAC control algorithm, energy system, and embedded platform at the system level [C11]; for co-scheduling heterogeneous energy loads (e.g., HVAC, EV charging) and energy supplies (e.g., grid electricity, battery storage) during operation [C31, C30, C21, C15]; for co-scheduling datacenter and HVAC loads in mixed-use buildings [C36]; and for optimally and correctly implementing the control algorithm on a distributed building platform, with consideration of physical elements such as building layout, sensor/actuator locations and environment dynamics [C8, J3]. We also proposed a proactive demand response strategy that integrates the operations of smart buildings into the energy scheduling of bulk power system [C29, C27, J11]. Recently, we developed a data-driven approach for HVAC control based on deep reinforcement learning [C41, C37].

Design frameworks for heterogeneous systems [C18, C4, J4]
I was part of the Metropolis project conducted at UC Berkeley, which provides a system level framework for modeling heterogeneous systems and performing design simulation, verification and synthesis. Recently, we worked on integrating Metro II with Ptolemy for timing verification [C18].

Extensibility optimization [C7, J2]
This work optimizes a task-level extensibility metric that measures how much the execution times of software tasks can be increased without violating design constraints. Optimizing extensibility allows adding future functionality or upgrading existing functionality without major redesign cycle, which is imperative for large-volume and long lifetime systems such as vehicles, airplanes and buildings.

In past, I also worked on CAD for circuits, including projects on logic synthesis and physical design:

SAT sweeping with local observability don't cares [C3]
Boolean reasoning is an essential part of electronic design automation. AND-INVERTER Graphs (AIGs) are often used to represent Boolean functions but have a high degree of structural redundancy. We proposed an extension of the SAT-sweeping algorithm that exploits local observability don't-cares (ODCs) to simplify AIGs.

Non-rectilinear global routing [C1, J1]
We proposed global routing algorithms for octilinear interconnect architecture, and extended them to general non-rectilinear interconnect.
I am also very interested in SoC design methodologies and tools. While in Berkeley, I worked with Intel on a project of exploring different implementations of JPEG encoder on Intel MXP5800 media processor [C2]. While at the Strategic CAD Labs in Intel, I worked on system level modeling and exploration methodologies and tools for Intel SoCs.
