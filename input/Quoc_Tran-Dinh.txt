About me

I am an associate professor at the Department of Statistics and Operations Research. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems (LIONS), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL),  Switzerland from November 2012 to June 2015. I completed my Ph.D. in Optimization in Engineering in November 2012 at the Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT) and Optimization in Engineering Center (OPTEC) under the supervision of Prof. Moritz Diehl.
