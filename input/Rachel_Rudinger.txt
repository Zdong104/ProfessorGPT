Publications

I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I also hold appointments in UMIACS and Linguistics at UMD.

My research focuses on problems in natural language understanding, including knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, an semantic representation. I am also interested in problems of bias and fairness in NLP, and in particular how commonsense reasoning can both lead to and help overcome social overgeneralization in NLP systems.
