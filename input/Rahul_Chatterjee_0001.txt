Research Service Teaching

I design secure systems to make digital technologies safe and secure for everyone. My research methodology combines empiricism with analytical techniques. Some of my recent research includes: designing secure and usable authentication systems, securing private data in trigger-action platforms, mitigating abuse of smart home devices by an abusive intimate partner, and building security mindset in CS undergraduate students. My CV can be found here. Also check out our Madison Security & Privacy group. I am always looking for self-motivated students who are interested in working on real-world digital security and privacy problems. If you have a relevant research idea and want to collaborate please drop me a note.

With the help of a number of motivated students, we run Madison Tech Clinic (MTC) to support survivors of domestic and intimate partner violence who are experiencing technology-faciliated abuse. This is an initiative similar to CETA in NYC. We are looking for passionate volunteers for MTC. Please reach out to me if you are interested.

Improving User Authentication Systems (S&P '19, SPACE '20, USENIX '22, USENIX '22)

Users regularly choose the same or similar passwords across multiple accounts. Therefore, attackers often use leaked password from one website to impersonate a user in other websites; this is called credential stuffing attack. A generalized version of such attack is what we call credential tweaking attack: an attacker uses a tailored list of guesses based on a previously leaked password for an account.

We are working on building defenses against the risk of account compromise via credential tweaking attacks. We have shown how damaging credential tweaking attack can be using recurrant neurl networks (RNNs): 15% of user accounts can be guessed using credential tweaking attack in 1,000 guesses, despite the target passwords being different from the ones that are leaked to the attacker. We built a personalized password strength meeter, called PPSM, and a service for privately discovering vulnerable passwords Might I Get Pwned (MIGP).

Mitigating Technology Abuse in Intimate Partner Violence (USENIX '23a, USENIX '23b, USENIX '23c)

Digital technologies such as smartphone, laptops, smarthome devices, and even social networks are regularly abused to spy, stalk, and harass survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV). In this project we are trying to understand the ecosystem of such tools that are either built for or repurposed for harming survivors. We found thousands of apps, many of them what we call dual-use — apps built for some legitimate purpose, but their functionality can be easily used for spying on an intimate partner, on official Android and iOS application stores. There are plenty of resources in the form of blogposts, forums, and videos to help an abuser use these tools for spying. We surveyed apps in fifteen different languages and found similar trends in distribution and advertisement of spyware across the globe. Currently I am looking into how smarthome devices are used against survivors of IPV.

We are running Madison Tech Clinic with Domestic Abuse Intervention Services (DAIS). I have helped create similar tech clinic in New York City in collaboration with End Domestic and Gender-based Violence (ENDGBV).

Securing Smart-Home and Smart-Industry Device Communications (USENIX '22, IEEE S&P '21)

Our physical environments are rapidly getting connected to the digital world. Smarthome devices are getting cheaper and easier to use by average users. While these devices allow easy automation of certain tasks, such as turn off the AC when everyone has left the home. However currently these automation tasks require the user to share sensitive in-home information with remote companies. We are working on securing this communication channels while maintaining the usefulness of smart-home devices and automation platforms.

Instilling Security Mindset in Undergraduate CS Students (ICER '20, SIGCSE '21, SIGCSE '22)

Undergraduate students in the US institutions can graudate with a CS degree without ever taking a computer security course. This is concerning as they will join the software developer workfoce that will write and maintain our cirtical infrastructure. We show that students not only lack knowledge of security, they don't even have some basic required skills, such as reading the function description details or understand a code snippet before copying it, to write secure code and identify potential security issues in a code. We are working on understanding how to educate students so that they have the required pieces to follow secure coding practices.
