Rahul Mangharam is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. He is a founding member of the PRECISE Center and directs the Safe Autonomous Systems Lab at Penn. His research is at the intersection of formal methods, machine learning and controls for medical devices, energy efficient buildings, & autonomous systems. 

He is the Penn Director for Safety21 US DoT National University Transportation Center ($20MM), Director of the Autoware Center of Excellence in Autonomous Driving, Board Member in The Autoware Foundation and Leader of the F1Tenth Autonomous Racing Community.       

Rahul received the 2016 US Presidential Early Career Award (PECASE), the 2014 IEEE Benjamin Franklin Key Award, 2013 NSF CAREER Award, 2012 Intel Early Faculty Career Award and was selected by the National Academy of Engineering for the 2012 and 2018 US Frontiers of Engineering.

Rahul's group has won several awards: 2020 2nd Best Paper Prize at ACM SIG Computer Scieicne Education , 2018 IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems Best Paper Award, 2017 American Controls Conference Best Paper Award for Energy Systems, 2016 DoE CleanTech Prize (Regional), SRC TECHCON 2015, IPSN 2012, RTAS 2102, Intel Innovators Award 2012, World Embedded Programming Competition 2012 and 2010, Honeywell Industrial Wireless Award 2011, and Google Zeitgeist Award 2011.

Rahul received his Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University where he also received his MS and BS. In 2002, he was a member of technical staff in the Ultra-Wide Band Wireless Group at Intel Labs. He was an international scholar in the Wireless Systems Group at IMEC, Belgium in 2003. He has worked on ASIC chip design at FORE Systems (1999) and Gigabit Ethernet at Apple Computer Inc. (2000). He was the Stephen J. Angelo Term Chair Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 2008-2013. He holds a secondary appointment in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences.
