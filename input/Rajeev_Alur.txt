Overview
My research is focused on formal methods for system design, and spans artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, distributed systems, logic in computer science, machine learning, and programming languages. I am the Director of ASSET (Center for AI-Enabled Systems: Safe, Explainable, and Trustworthy), and also a member of Penn's PRECISE Center and PL Club.

Research
My current research is primarily focused on Trustworthy AI and Safe Autonomy. Autonomous systems increasingly rely on machine learning for making decisions. When such systems are used in safety-critical applications such as driverless cars and medical devices, we need guarantees regarding their safety. This motivates research on integrating logical reasoning in learning algorithms. Representative research directions are:
How to formally verify closed-loop systems that include a neural-network-based controller? Sample publications: Verisig, EMSOFT'21; Talk (Jan 20)
How to integrate logical specifications in reinforcement learning? Sample publications: Temporal logic in RL: Survey, SPECTRL; AAAI'23 Tutorial slides
Here are some selected contributions from my past research (complete list of publications):
Programming abstractions for stream processing systems: Quantitative Regular Expressions, StreamQRE system, and Synchronization schemas, and a talk (April 2018).
Syntax-guided program synthesis; see original paper and overview talk (April 2021) developed as part of the NSF Expeditions in Computer Augmented Program Engineering (ExCAPE) project.
All regular transformations in a single pass: Streaming string transducers (see talk), Streaming tree transducers
Nested Words (aka visibly pushdown languages) for modeling data with linear-hierarchical structure
Architecture-aware analysis of concurrent software (see PLDI 2007 paper on CheckFence)
Automata-theoretic approach for compositional scheduling of embedded control software (representative publication)
CHARON for modeling and verification of hybrid systems
Multi-agent systems: Reactive Modules (FMSD 1999 paper), Mocha, Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (JACM 2002 paper)
Specification, Analysis, and Testing of Scenario-based Requirements.
Hybrid automata (TCS 1995 paper)
Real-time temporal logics: TPTL (JACM 1994 paper), TCTL (I&C 1993 paper), MITL (JACM 1996 paper)
Timed automata (TCS 1994 paper); see blogpost and interview when awarded 2016 Alonzo Church award for outstanding contributions to logic and computation.
Teaching
Spring 2024: Trustworthy Machine Learning
At the undergraduate level, I teach CIS 2620: Automata, Computability, and Complexity, usually each Fall semester. To help students learn the basic model of deterministic finite automata, we have developed an interactive tool AutomataTutor with novel features for automatically generated feedback and automatic grading. If you are an instructor teaching a course on this topic, please encourage your students to use this tool, and if you want to set up a homework assignment using our tool, send us an email!
CIS 6730: Computer-Aided Verification. Next offering: Spring 2023.
To train Masters students in the cross-disciplinary skills required for the emerging area of embedded and cyber-physical systems, Penn Engineering started a new program EMBS that I directed for many years. For many years, I taught CIS 540: Principles of Embedded Computation for this program. On this topic, I have written the textbook Principles of Cyber-Physical Systems which was published by MIT Press in April 2015. There are lots of teaching resources such as exercises, solutions, slides, and projects, available if you want to teach a similar course.
