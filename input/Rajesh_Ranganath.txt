About

I am an Assistant Professor at the Courant Institute at NYU in Computer Science and at the Center for Data Science. I am also part of the CILVR group. My research interests include causal, statistical, and probabilistic inference, out-of-distribution detection and generalization, deep generative modeling, interpretability, and machine learning for healthcare. Before joining NYU, I earned degrees in computer science; my PhD was completed at Princeton University working with Dave Blei and my undergraduate was done at Stanford University. I have also spent time as a research affiliate at MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.
