Curriculum Vitae
Research
Theory/Logic:

My research focuses on the relationship between computation (complexity) and Logic, focusing on implicit complexity (relating logical complexity of concepts to computational, resource-based complexity). I am also interested in formalizing emerging models of computation such as biological neural networks and studying conceptual complexity in these settings. I am also interested in Learning theory (complexity of learning).

Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence:

I am interested in learning symbolic models - especially using non-symbolic models. This interest spans from interpretable AI to Differential Inductive Logic Programming to grammar learning to other forms of program synthesis to using reinforcement learning for pipeline synthesis to proof synthesis. I am particularly interested in the modularity/hierarchy of the learned models and using higher-order structural heuristics and learned program specifications to guide the model synthesis.

I am also interested in using machine learning/data mining techniques to solve real-world problems. Further, I am interested in advancements in neural networks - especially biologically inspired developments.
