I received the B.Sc. (1994) and M.Sc. (1998) from Tel-Aviv University and the Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology (2004), all in Electrical Engineering. From Fall 2004 to Summer 2007, I was a postdoctoral research fellow with the EECS department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. I joined the School of EECS at Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR in Fall 2007. My research interests include statistical signal processing, machine learning, inverse problem, sparse signal reconstruction, manifold learning, and adaptive sensing.
