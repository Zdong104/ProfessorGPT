Personal History
I grew up in the 60's and 70's in the small town of O'Fallon Illinois where starting in 1967 I attended St. Clare grade school and, starting in 1975, O'Fallon Township Highschool. See a scanned version of a paper I wrote (on a typewriter!) for a high-school English class when I was only 17 years old entitled "High-level Artificial Intelligence: An Imminent Possibility with an Enormous Potential for Good". My enthusiasm for AI started early and has not waned; however, my expections about AI's rate of progress and its positive social implications have matured and (hopefully) become more realistic.

In the fall of 1979, I went to the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana to obtain all of the degrees listed above. In December 1987, I completed my Ph.D. thesis under the direction of Prof. Gerald DeJong and then began as a faculty member here in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin.

See more information on my academic genealogy, which traces my professorial lineage back through Danish Linguists to German Theologians.

Recently, I have become particularly well known for a certain strongly stated comment, which can be embedded into the following vector: (0.62384789, 0.232328242, 0.2394182754, 0.9234583745, 0.9034527345, 0.2348534598743, 0.789045724387, 0.34750893274895, 0.23475809273485723, 0.23452374958, 0.094358923475823475, 0.908452352348905, 0.024375823785, 0.980459238409582345) (click to decode).

Note to Potential Grad-Student and Internship Applicants
Unfortunately, I am unable to personally respond to email requests regarding application to our graduate program or other solicitations for positions in my research lab. I encourage potential graduate-student applicants to see the department information on applying to our graduate program. I am no longer recruiting new Ph.D. students. I am afraid I currently have no funding or capacity to advise summer internships.
