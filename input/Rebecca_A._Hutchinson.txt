Research Interests
My research is at the intersection of machine learning and ecology. I am part of the computational sustainability community, trying to find ways that computer science can contribute to promoting the health of the Earth’s ecosystems and bringing interesting new problems back to computer science. Much of my work is on computational methods for species distribution modeling, a problem in which data describing sightings of a species are combined with environmental variables to produce habitat models. I work with hierarchical latent variable models that represent both ecological and observation processes; for example, occupancy models and their variants fall within this paradigm.  My current research is on robust parameter estimation methods for these models and techniques for incorporating semi-parametric techniques into probabilistic models.  I am also interested in methods for analyzing species interaction networks and strategies for evaluating species distribution models.
