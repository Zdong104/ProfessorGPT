New diagnostic tool in battle against breast cancer

How artificial intelligence may help detect early signs of breast cancer years before symptoms.                                       

Is artificial intelligence about to transform the mammogram?

An MIT researcher who survived breast cancer has devised a technique that seems to predict many breast cancer cases.

A path forward for trusted AI in breast cancer risk prediction

As the role of artificial intelligence grows in medicine, one of the leading concerns is that algorithmic tools will perpetuate disparities in care.

These Doctors Are Using AI to Screen for Breast Cancer

During the pandemic, thousands of women have skipped scans and check-ups. So physicians tapped an algorithm to predict those at the highest risk.

A leading AI researcher calls for standards to ensure equity and fairness

A top researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Thursday said that artificial intelligence systems developed for medicine must be more transparent and judged against a set...

MIT Professor Who Advanced Cancer Treatment Wins $1 Million AI Prize

Regina Barzilay, a breast cancer survivor, was recognized for her work in breast-cancer detection and drug discovery.

Machine learning has been used to automatically translate long-lost languages

Some languages that have never been deciphered could be the next ones to get the machine translation treatment.

Can these researchers catch cancer much earlier than ever before?

From revolutionizing the mammogram to spotting a single tumor cell in the blood...

Looking to Technology to Avoid Doctors’ Offices and Emergency Rooms

Americans are eagerly turning to the latest tech devices in hopes of preventing and detecting medical problems early...

Learning to Cure

Data collected about millions of cancer patients — their pathology slides, imaging, and other tests — contain answers to many open questions in oncology. Jointly with the MGH collaborators, we are developing algorithms that can learn from this data to improve models of disease progression, prevent over-treatment, and narrow down to the cure. On the NLP side, we are creating databases which record pertinent cancer features extracted from raw documents. On the computer vision side, we are working on deep learning models that compute personalized assessment from mammogram data focusing on early cancer detection.

ML Drug Discovery

Today, drug discovery involves practitioners with years of advanced training and is carried out in a trial-and-error, labor-intensive fashion. Our goal is to change a traditional discovery pipeline. In a joint work with chemical engineers and biologists at MIT, we are working on deep learning methods for modeling biological and physicochemical properties, de-novo molecular design, and retrosynthesis.  On the ML side, this area brings many interesting questions related to learning molecular representations, interpretability and robustness. As part of the MLPDS consortium, we are continuously learning  from the deployment of our models in the pharmaceutical industry, directing the development towards our ultimate goal to change the drug discovery process.
