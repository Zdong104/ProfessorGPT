Teaching Interests

 CSC 7260 - Distributed Systems (every Winter): Both basic distributed computing ideas and system designs that support distributed applications will be covered in this course. The following learning outcomes are part of the course: a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of distributed computing, construction of distributed system components, and comprehension of the current state of the art in various areas of distributed systems. This includes studying abstract concepts and practical methods for creating system support for distributed applications.

CSC 5991 - In-network Computing (every Winter): The Intel® Tofino™ series of P4-programmable Ethernet switch ASICs deliver more flexibility for data centers. Monitor and control packet processing and update protocols in software to deliver customized performance for specific workloads at scale. More control and visibility in the network open a variety of opportunities including easy network optimization, cost efficiency, and rich visibility. This class will cover the foundations and advanced topics in network programmability, helping students understand a variety of real-world challenges that future networking encounters and state-of-the-art solutions.
