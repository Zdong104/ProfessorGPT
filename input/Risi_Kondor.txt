	My group is focused on fundamental methodological developments in machine learning, specifically machine learning for physics and chemistry. Much of our work is related to computational harmonic analysis and group representation theory. We are responsible for some foundational work on equivariant neural networks. We are also engaged in developing high performance, open source software in both C++ and Python.
