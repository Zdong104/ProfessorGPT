About Me

I am the John E. Savage Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Data Science and a member of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown University.  My research lab develops machine learning methods with the goals of data integration and model interpretation for biological and biomedical applications.

Prior to joining Brown, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Noble Lab at the University of Washington. I completed my Ph.D. in 2018 from the University of Virginia with Dr. Yanjun Qi as my advisor. My research involves developing integrative and interpretable machine learning/deep learning models for important biological and clinical questions.

I have received the NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award and Brown University’s Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award for developing deep learning methods to integrate and model genomics datasets. I also recently received the Dean’s Award for Excellence in Teaching at Brown.
