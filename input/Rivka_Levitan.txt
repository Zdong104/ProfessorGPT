Rivka Levitan is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Brooklyn College and in the Computer Science and Linguistics Doctoral Programs at the CUNY Graduate Center. She received her PhD in computer science from Columbia University in 2014. Her research focuses on the detection of paralinguistic and affective information from speech and language, with special interest in the information carried by dialogue and prosody. She received a NSF CAREER award and a CUNY Junior Faculty Research Award from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.


Research interests:
NLP, speech, dialogue, conversational agents, analysis of intonation, social signals derivable from speech, discourse analysis.
