Background
My research area is Computer Vision, with current emphasis on video scene understanding, human body segmentation, activity analysis, and real-time tracking. I teach courses in the CSE and EE departments at PSU on Computer Vision and Image Processing, and run the CSE Laboratory for Perception, Action and Cognition (LPAC).

Since Jan 2005: Associate Professor, CSE Department, Penn State University.
1996-2004: Research Faculty, Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University.
1994-1996: Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
1994: Ph.D., CS Department, University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

New Course Spring 2023
