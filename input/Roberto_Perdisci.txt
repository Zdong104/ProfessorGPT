I am a Professor in the School of Computing at the University of Georgia, where I hold the Patty and D.R. Grimes Distinguished Professorship in Computer Science and direct the UGA Institute for Cybersecurity and Privacy. I am also an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Georgia Tech School of Computer Science and a faculty member of the UGA Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Before joining UGA I was Post-Doctoral Fellow at the College of Computing of the Georgia Institute of Technology, working under the supervision of Prof. Wenke Lee. Before that, I was Research Scholar at the Georgia Tech Information Security Center and PhD candidate at the University of Cagliari, Italy with the Pattern Recognition and Applications Group.

My research focuses on securing networked systems. I am particularly interested in web security, automating the analysis of security incidents, and defending networks from malware. I often combine systems research with machine learning and large-scale data mining techniques to solve challenging computer and network security problems. I am also interested in broader aspects of networked systems, including Internet-scale measurements, analysis and optimization of systems performance, and the design of networking protocols. In 2012, I received an NSF CAREER award on a project titled “Automatic Learning of Adaptive Network-Centric Malware Detection Models.”
