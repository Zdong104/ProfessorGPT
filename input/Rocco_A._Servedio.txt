A Very Brief And Dry Biography
Before coming to Columbia I was an NSF Mathematical Sciences postdoc in the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. I received my Ph.D in computer science, my MS in computer science, and my AB in Mathematics all from Harvard.

I served as Chair of the Computer Science Department at Columbia from 2018 to 2021.

"I'll tell you what you can do," he said. "You can find the coffee pot you used last time you made coffee and maybe there's some grounds left over in the ground holder and you can give me a paper napkin and I can saturate the napkin with soggy coffee grounds and just hold it under my nose and sniff it for a little while."

-- D. DeLillo, Great Jones Street
