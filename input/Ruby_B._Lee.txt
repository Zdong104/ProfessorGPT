Biography: (Lee_shortbio , Lee_NSFbio)

Ruby B. Lee is the Forrest G. Hamrick Professor of Engineering and Professor of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, with an affiliated appointment in the Computer Science department. She is the director of the Princeton Architecture Laboratory for Multimedia and Security (PALMS). Her current research is in designing security and new media support into core computer architecture, embedded systems and global networked systems, and in architectures resistant to Distributed Denial of Service attacks and Internet-scale epidemics.� She teaches courses in Cyber Security and Processor Architectures for New Paradigms.� She is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE).� She is Associate Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Micro and Editorial Board member of IEEE Security and Privacy.

Prior to joining the Princeton faculty in 1998, Dr. Lee served as chief architect at Hewlett-Packard, responsible at different times for processor architecture, multimedia architecture and security architecture for e-commerce and extended enterprises. She was a key architect in the definition and evolution of the PA-RISC architecture used in HP servers and workstations, and also led the first CMOS PA-RISC single-chip microprocessor design. As chief architect for HP�s multimedia architecture team, Dr. Lee led an inter-disciplinary team focused on architecture to facilitate pervasive multimedia information processing using general-purpose computers. This resulted in the first desktop computer family with integrated, software-based, high fidelity, real-time multimedia.� Dr. Lee also co-led a multimedia architecture team for IA-64.� Concurrent with full-time employment at HP, Dr. Lee also served as Consulting Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.� She has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and a M.S. in Computer Science, both from Stanford University, and an A.B. with distinction from Cornell University, where she was a College Scholar. She is an elected member of Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Lambda Delta. She has been granted 115 United States and international patents, with several patents pending.
