I am an associate professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at UMass Amherst. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia in 2006, and was previously a member of the Computer Graphics group at UVA. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University in 2001. My research interests are in the field of computer graphics, with focuses on global illumination algorithms, interactive photorealistic rendering, and appearance modeling. I currently lead the Computer Graphics Research Group at UMass Amherst. I received an NSF CAREER award in 2008.

Code and demo for selected projects are available for download below.

I was on leave of absense from Fall 2013 to Fall 2014 to work on open-source hardware projects (see OpenSprinkler.com and Rayshobby.net).
