About me

Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department of J.B. Speed School of Engineering at the University of Louisville. I received my PhD in Information Sciences and Technology from the Pennsylvania State University in 2023, Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from Tsinghua University.

My research interests span the areas of computer vision, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and robotics. My research employs a hybrid approach integrating data-driven learning and human-centered design to address major human-centric challenges.

To Prospective Students

I am seeking motivated students interested in computer vision and/or human-computer interaction research. If you are a student at the UofL or in the Louisville area and wish to explore research opportunities, please email me.
