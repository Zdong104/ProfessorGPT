Rui Zhang is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Penn State University. He is a co-director of the PSU Natural Language Processing Lab. He served as an area chair at NAACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, AACL, NLPCC, a tutorial chair at NAACL, and a mentor in ACL Year-Round Mentorship. His research interest lies in Trustworthy Human-Centered AI, LLM Agents, and AI for Science. He received an Amazon Research Award, an eBay Research Award, and a Cisco Research Award. He received B.S. degrees from both Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Michigan in 2015 and received his Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department at Yale University in 2020. He has done industry research internships at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Grammarly Research, and Google AI.
Research Interests
I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. I work on both Science of LLMs and LLMs for Science, especially focusing on
