Assistant Professor
Computer Science at USC
Machine learning, Biomedical AI, Computational genomics

Hi! I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at USC. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 2022, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. James Zou. I was a postdoctoral scholar in the department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University from 2022 to 2023. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree in Physics from Peking University.

My research lies in the intersection of machine learning and applications in human diseases, health and genomics. I was selected as Rising Star in Data Science, Next Generation in Biomedicine, and Rising Star in Engineering in Health. Very honored that my project Trial Pathfinder - using AI to make clinical trials more inclusive - was selected as 2022 Top Ten Clinical Research Achievement and Finalist for Global Pharma Award 2021.

I direct the Laboratory for Machine Learning, Health and Biomedicine at USC. We focus on a variety of machine learning problems inspired by health and biomedicine challenges. Our work involves developing efficient and reliable new algorithms in deep learning, large language models, reinforcement learning, and more. We are also committed to translating our efforts into impactful real-world applications, notably in areas like precision medicine and clinical trials.



I am currently seeking for Ph.D. students (Fall 2025), Postdoc, and Research Interns who share our passion in ML & Biomedical AI. Feel free to contact if you are interested to join!
