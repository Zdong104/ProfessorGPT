Description:  

 

 

Hi, this is Ruoming Jin's homepage

 

I am an associate professor in the Computer Science Department, Kent State University.

My general research interests are on Data Mining, Database, Biomedical Informatics and Cloud Computing.

My current research focus is on Big Data, especially, Big Graph Data! My group is developing novel algorithmic and system solutions to manage and analyze massive graph and network data. We also work on the applications of graph/network mining on semantic web, social network, biomedical informatics, and transportation systems.
