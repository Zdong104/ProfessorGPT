Ruqi Zhang

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning, UT Austin. I completed my PhD at Cornell University, where I was advised by Chris De Sa.




A Postdoctoral position is currently open in our lab. For further details, please visit here.

I am looking for highly motivated students (PhD, MS, undergrads, and interns) to join our lab. If you are interested, feel free to reach out.

Research Interests

I am interested in building scalable, reliable and efficient probabilistic models for machine learning and data science. Currently, I focus on developing fast and robust sampling and probabilistic inference methods with theoretical guarantees and their applications with deep neural networks on real-world big data.
