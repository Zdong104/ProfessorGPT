Research

For many years, starting in the late 1980's at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, my research has focused on all aspects of computer-integrated interventional medicine. Broadly, this research has included:

Medical robotics;
Medical imaging & modeling;and
Complete systems for surgical assistance, image-guided surgery, and what I refer to as "Surgical CAD/CAM".

An underlying theme has been the basic insight that information-based technologies can have just as profound an impact on computer-integrated medicine as it has had on computer-integrated manufacturing.

Some of my current and recent research projects include work on systems, medical robotics for microsurgery and MIS, statistical modeling and deformable 2D-3D registration, radiation oncology planning, and human-machine cooperative systems in surgery.

More information may be found on the Research Page of this web site and on the web site for the Computer-Integrated Interventional Systems Lab. Information about my early medical robotics work at IBM can be found by following this link.  Information about my other earlier work can be found by following this link. Also, here is a link to a December 2021 interview in Computer Vision News where I talk about how I see the field evolving.

Publications

You can find a (somewhat complete) list of my publications in my curriculum vita.  An extended (2 page) bio-sketch can be found here, and a shorter version can be found here on my faculty page on the CS Department website.

Courses
Computer-Integrated Surgery Course Sequence

The Computer Science Department has recently changed the numbers of this coruse from 600.445/645 to 610.455/655. There will also be changes in the CIS II course numbers. Further changes to this and the CIS II web site will be made as soon as I can get the new numbers clarified.

Fall 2023 Schedule
Computer-Integrated Surgery II (601.456/656/496/452)
Computer-Integrated Surgery II Schedule for Spring 2024
Other Courses
Medical Image Analysis Seminar (601.856 / 520.746 - previously also 600.746)
