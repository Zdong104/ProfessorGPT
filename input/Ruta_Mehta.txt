Biography

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science. Prior to joining UIUC, I did postdoc at Simons Institute for Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley (Aug'15 to Dec'15), and in College of Computing at Georgia Tech (Aug'12 to July'15, advisor: Prof. Vijay V. Vazirani). I received my Ph.D. in computer science from IIT-Bombay under the supervision of Prof. Milind Sohoni and Prof. Bharat Adsul, in August 2012. My Ph.D. thesis titled "Nash Equilibrium Computation in Various Games" won the ACM India Doctoral Dissertation Award, 2012.

Course Development
CS 580: Topics on Algorithmic Game Theory
Research Statement

My research is primarily in theoretical computer science. It looks at the fundamental solution concepts from economics, game theory, and social choice from the computational lens. I am also interested in understanding questions related to fairness in society, and evolution in nature.

My main research interests lie in the areas of algorithmic game theory, mathematical economics, and in design of efficient algorithms. I am interested in exploring the computability of equilibria, both market and Nash, under various settings, and also understanding the impact of strategic behavior in multi-agent situations. Currently, I am exploring problems from dynamic matching, fair division of scarce resources, and market design for cloud computing. In addition I am exploring avenues for interdisciplinary applications of these tools to genetic evolution, machine learning and dynamical systems.

Research Interests
Algorithmic Game Theory: Equilibrium Computation and Complexity, Smoothed Analysis, Learning in Games, Strategic and Dynamic Aspects
Fair division
Interdisciplinary applications of game-theoretic tools to machine learning, genetic evolution, and climate change.
