April 2017 - I have received an NSF CAREER Award for my proposal "Inverse Origami: Generalized Pose-Normalization for Large-Scale Fine-Grained Recognition".




RESEARCH · My research focuses on the emerging field of fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC), where, instead of recognizing objects at a coarse level (e.g. bird or car), we tackle the difficult task of training a computer to find the highly-localized and often subtle characteristics (differences in shape, coloration, etc.) that allow precise identification at the level of fine-grained or "subordinate-level" categories (e.g. genus/species, make/model/year). Overcoming this key challenge bridges the divide between objects in the visual world around us and the vast wealth of digital information about them.

TEACHING · 	Winter 2020: CS493R - Competitive Programming and Coding Interview Prep
Winter 2020: CS312 - Algorithm Design and Analysis

PERSONAL · The most important things in my life are my family and my faith.  I consider myself fortunate to be married to my best friend and sweetheart and to be a devoted father to three wonderful children.  I spend most of my free time with them and with friends.  When occasion permits (and it rarely does these days), I pursue my favorite hobby, birding.
