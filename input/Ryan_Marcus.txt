I'm Ryan Marcus, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm using machine learning to build the next generation of data management tools that automatically adapt to new hardware and user workloads, invent novel processing strategies, and understand user intention.

I am especially interested in query optimization, index structures, intelligent clouds, programming language runtimes, program synthesis for data processing, and applications of reinforcement learning to systems problems.
