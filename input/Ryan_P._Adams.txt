Recently, someone has been sending out scam/phishing emails claiming that I am seeking applications for research internships. Please do not engage with these emails but instead report them to phishbowl@princeton.edu.

I am interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computational statistics, with applications across science and engineering. I have broad interests but often work on probabilistic methods and approximate Bayesian inference. I am Associate Chair of the Computer Science Department, the director of the Undergraduate Certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning, and Associated Faculty in the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics. I co-founded Whetlab (sold to Twitter in 2015) and formerly co-hosted the Talking Machines podcast. I was faculty at Harvard from 2011 to 2016 and was at Twitter and then Google Brain before joining the faculty at Princeton in 2018. I call my group the Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems (LIPS).
