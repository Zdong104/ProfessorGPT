Miscellaneous

As of January 2017, I'm a faculty member at Princeton University in the Department of Computer Science.

My primary research interest is in Algorithmic Mechanism Design: algorithm design in settings where users have their own incentives. I'm also interested more broadly in Economics and Computation, Algorithms Under Uncertainty, and Theoretical Computer Science in general. See here for more details.

Before joining the faculty at Princeton, I spent two years as a postdoc in Princeton's CS Theory group, and was a research fellow at the Simons Institute during the Fall 2015 (Economics and Computation) and Fall 2016 (Algorithms and Uncertainty) semesters. I completed my PhD in 2014 at MIT, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Costis Daskalakis. Prior to that, I graduated from Cornell University with a BA in Math in 2010, where I was also fortunate to have worked with Bobby Kleinberg.
