About

The focus of my research is to develop theoretically sound methods, which are both computationally and statistically efficient, for extracting information from large datasets. A salient feature of my work has been to understand how hidden low-complexity structure in large datasets can be used to develop computationally and statistically efficient methods for extracting meaningful information for high-dimensional estimation problems. My work borrows from and improves upon tools of statistical signal processing, machine learning, probability and convex optimization. In the past I applied these ideas to outcomes research in collaborations with the Yale Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation. Prior to that I worked with Prof. Devavrat Shah at MIT as a postdoc and Prof. Martin J. Wainwright at UC Berkeley as a graduate student.
