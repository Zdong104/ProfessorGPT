About Me

Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at NYU Courant. I am also affiliated with NYU Center for Data Science. Before that I was a research scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), Menlo Park. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from CSE Department at UC San Diego, advised by Zhuowen Tu. During my PhD study, I also interned at NEC Labs, Adobe, Facebook, Google, DeepMind. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My primary areas of interest in research are deep learning and computer vision. My goal is to develop improved representation learning techniques that aid machines in comprehending and utilizing massive amounts of structured information, as well as to push the boundaries of visual recognition by learning better representations at scale.

News
Started as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU. Multiple positions available!
Georgia and I are organizing the "Quo Vadis, Computer Vision?" workshop at ICCV 2023. See you in Paris.
Prospective PhD Students
I'm seeking PhD candidates to join our group starting in Fall 2024. If you're interested in collaborating with me for your doctoral studies, please submit your application to the Courant CS Ph.D. program and be sure to include my name in your application materials.
Internship opportunity
From time to time, our group at NYU offers visiting researcher positions for individuals from different backgrounds. If you possess a strong passion for applying representation learning to tackle complex challenges in machine learning, computer vision (among many other exciting domains!), please feel free to send me an email with your CV.
Services
I am serving as an Area Chair for NeurIPS 2023, ECCV 2020/2022, ICCV 2021/2023, and CVPR 2021/2022, ICLR 2024.
