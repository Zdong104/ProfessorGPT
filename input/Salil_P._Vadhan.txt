I am a member of Harvard's Theory of Computation research group and also lead Harvard's Privacy Tools Project and co-lead the OpenDP open-source differential privacy software project.  My research areas include computational complexity, cryptography, randomness in computation, and data privacy.

I am on sabbatical during the 2023-24 academic year and will not be teaching or physically present at Harvard.  During my sabbatical I will still have Zoom office hours, to be posted in "Upcoming Events", below. If you need to meet at a time outside of office hours, please contact my faculty coordinator Allison Choat <achoat@g.harvard.edu>.

My 2012 monograph on Pseudorandomness is on my former website.

See FAQ with answers to common inquiries (including reference letters, graduate admissions, advising, internal and external service, appointments, and refereeing) and information on contacting me.
