Update: I am no longer an assistant professor at Duke (and am therefore no longer recruiting students). Details TK.

About me: I’m an assistant professor at Duke University’s Department of Computer Science, and I’m interested in natural language processing and machine learning. Before Duke, I was a research assistant professor at TTIC, and before that a PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard, where I was advised by Sasha Rush and Stuart Shieber.

Here’s my CV.
