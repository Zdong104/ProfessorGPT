Research Interests
My work is in the areas of Algorithm Design, specifically on graph algorithms, combinatorics, scheduling and approximation algorithms. Specifically, my research is motivated by algorithmic questions arising in the context of data storage, communication, clustering and load balancing. I have published widely on these areas, and have advised a number of graduate and undergraduate students who worked in these topics.
Current Work
From 2003-2008, I was the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, and then from 2012-2017, I was the inaugural Elizabeth Iribe Chair for CS at University of Maryland. In 2019, I joined Northwestern Computer Science, a newly created independent Computer Science department, where I am currently the Peter and Adrienne Barris Chair for Computer Science and a Professor in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.
