Hi, I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University. My research lies at the intersections of theoretical computer science, data science, and machine learning. In particular, I am currently interested in numerical linear algebra, streaming algorithms, and differential privacy. Here are some of my favorite links.
