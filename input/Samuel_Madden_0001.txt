Research
My primary research focus is on database systems, including main memory databases, data warehousing/analytics, querying video data, and machine learning for data systems.

Recent and current research projects and interests include:

BRAD: Simplifying Cloud Data Processing
Self organzing data containers, and several other projects on learned data layouts.
Starling, looking at building database systems on ephemeral computing services like AWS Lambda.
VaaS (Video Analytics as a service), a system for query processing over video, and various other video querying projects.
TGDB, a system for efficient temporal graph analytics.

Various other projects are listed on the DSG Website and project page.

Past projects include:
Mapster a set of tools for generating street maps from satellite imagery and GPS traces.

Datahub, a "github for data" platform that provides hosted database storage, versioning, ingest, search, and visualization.

BlinkDB A system for runing queries with bounded errors and bounded response times on very large data

Silo, a main memory high throughput transaction processing system that uses novel concurrency control algorithms and lock free data structures to provide scalability without partitioning.

The CarTel networking and data management system for mobile sensor networks.

C-Store, a column-oriented high performance database system for warehouse and semantic web applications.

Relational Cloud, a project looking at building a scalable database service for the cloud.

H-Store, a next generation high-performance OLTP engine.

WaveScope, a signal-oriented stream processing system.

Qurk, a project investigating how people (as accessed via crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon's Mechanical Turk) can be integrated into query processing.

SciDB, a multi-institution project developing a data management platform for scientific applications, including astronomy and computational biology.
The MACAQUE project, which focused on identifying ways to make data collected from sensor networks more reliable and useful.

Developing novel query processing and optimization techniques for sensor networks and other acquisitional systems.

TinyDB (a part of TinyOS.)

Aurora/Borealis stream processor. TelegraphCQ continuous query processor.
