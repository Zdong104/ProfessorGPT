I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at the University of California, Irvine. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer systems, networking, and machine learning. Prior to UCI, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2019 where I was advised by Brighten Godfrey and had a brief stint as a postdoc at VMware Research.

I lead the Networking, Systems, and AI Lab (NetSAIL) at UCI. My current focus revolves around:
- Internet and Cloud Resilience
- Systems and Machine Learning
