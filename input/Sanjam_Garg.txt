I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Division at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in cryptography and its applications to security and privacy. Prior to this, I was a Josef Raviv Memorial Postdoctoral Fellow at IBM Research T.J. Watson. I got my PhD in Computer Science from University of California, Los Angeles in 2013 and my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 2008.
