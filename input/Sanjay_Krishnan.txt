Data Science Research @ U Chicago

As humans, we understand that intelligence is inherrently decentralized and collaborative. Effective teams bring together multiple specialized skillsets to solve hard problems. Why can’t computer leverage this same principle?

Ongoing Projects

Decentralized Prediction. Our group is exploring how nodes on a distributed network can efficiently coordinate to make fast collective decisions. For example, a set of servers deciding whether a cyber-attack is currently happening or a set of robots identifying an object in a room.
Effective Data Science Teams. As data science efforts proliferate through every organization, tools are needed to track data movement, data access, and data usage. What makes data science teams more effective?
Sustainable AI. How do we assess the carbon footprint of AI models and data science processes? We study how to account for carbon costs when the data “value chains” span multiple organizations and teams.
