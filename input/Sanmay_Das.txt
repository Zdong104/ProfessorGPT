Research
I have broad interests across AI, machine learning, and computational social science. I have worked mainly on designing effective algorithms for agents in complex, uncertain environments, and on understanding the social or collective outcomes of individual behavior. My research spans market microstructure, matching markets, social networks, reinforcement learning, sequential decision-making, supervised learning, and data mining. My recent work focuses on the use of AI in the allocation of scarce societal resources, with an eye towards the distributive justice implications of different policies and mechanisms. For more details, you can read some of my papers.
Professional Bio (for talk announcements, etc.)
Sanmay Das is Professor of Computer Science and co-director of the Center for Advancing Human-Machine Partnership at George Mason University. He has broad interests across artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational social science. His recent work focuses on the use of AI in the allocation of scarce societal resources, with an eye towards the distributive justice implications of different policies and mechanisms. Das is active in the international AI community. He currently serves as chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence, a member of the board of directors of the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, and a member of DARPA's ISAT study group, among other advisory and editorial boards. He was program co-chair of the 2017 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems and the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, and associate program co-chair for the 2023 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. He has been recognized with awards for research, teaching, and service, including a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the Department Chair Award for Outstanding Teaching at Washington University, and the Outstanding Service Award from the Computer Science Department at George Mason University. He was selected as an ACM Distinguished Member in 2023 for contributions to AI and economics, AI for social good, and for service to the profession. He has also worked with the US Treasury department on machine learning approaches to credit risk analysis and occasionally consults in the areas of technology and finance.
Selected Audio/Video and Media Coverage
I say a few things about bias in AI in this CACM article.


It was an honor to speak with the Provost of GMU as part of the Mason Vision Series. A recording of the conversation is available here: Justice in an AI-Mediated Society.


One benefit of Zoom talks is that people record them! Some recent recorded talks can give you a flavor of what I'm working on! University of Maryland Fairness in AI Seminar, Penn State AI for Social Impact Seminar, USC CAIS Symposium joint keynote (with Patrick Fowler)


I did a fun interview with Dave Costenaro and Fully Teasdale of prepare.ai


I have a brief cameo about 25 minutes into Peter Warren's PassWOrd show that focused on AI


Recording of an interview with Jay Kanzler on KTRS where I talk about search, bias, algorithms, and society.


I talked about machine learning for credit risk on a techemergence podcast.


Videos of a session in which I gave the second talk and interview I gave on prediction markets at the Microsoft Research Faculty Summit are online (along with a ton of other interesting talks and interviews!)


The Wikimedia research newsletter of September 2013 discussed some of our work on manipulation in Wikipedia


An INFORMS Daily Report blog post from 2008 on some of our Wikipedia research


An article from The Economist in 2003, describing some of my research on modeling financial markets
