I am an Assistant Professor in the CS Department at Cornell.
I can't guarantee a reply to every email. I do not have the capacity to supervise remote internships.

I study the interplay between optimization, machine learning, and dynamics in real-world systems. My research focuses on understanding the fundamentals of data-driven methods for control and decision-making, inspired by applications ranging from robotics to recommendation systems. You can learn more by reading my dissertation or watching my dissertation talk.

In fall 2021, I was a postdoc with Jamie Morgenstern at UW. Before that, I was a PhD student in EECS at UC Berkeley, advised by Ben Recht. At Berkeley, I was a founding member of Graduates for Engaged and Extended Scholarship in computing and Engineering (GEESE). I interned with Canopy in Boston, MA during Summer 2019.
For reference, my job talk, CV, faculty app, and NSF GRFP app.

Teaching

At Cornell, I am teaching CS 4/5789: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning in Spring 2024 (previously in 2022, 2023). I taught Machine Learning in Feedback Systems (CS 6784) in Fall 2023 (previously in 2022).

At Berkeley, I worked on course development for a new EECS Anti-Racism and Social Justice course (and gave a guest lecture on Bias in Algorithms) and as a Graduate Student Instructor for Statistical Learning Theory (EECS 281) and Introduction to Machine Learning (EECS 189/289).

Advising and Mentoring

I've had the pleasure of working with several students at Cornell, including PhD advisees Kimia Kazemian, Raunak Kumar (co-advised with Bobby Kleinberg), and Rohan Banerjee (co-advised with Tapo Bhattacharjee); undergraduates Vadim Popov (2023), Rachael Close (2023), Amelia Kovacs (2022-present), Alexis Hao (2022), Emily Mei (2022), Fengyu Li (2022), Jiwoo Cheon (2022).
