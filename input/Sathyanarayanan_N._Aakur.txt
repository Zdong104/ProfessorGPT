About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Software Engineering Deoartment at Auburn University. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater.

I received my PhD from University of South Florida, where I worked with Dr. Sudeep Sarkar in the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Group and with Dr. Kenneth Malmberg. I received my Master's degree in Management Information Systems from the Muma College of Business at the University of South Florida and my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Velammal Engineering College, Anna University, India.

Research

In my research, I’m broadly interested in the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and psychology: I aim to build intelligent agents that understand the visual world beyond recognition (labels) or captions (sentences) without the need for explicit human supervision through expensive annotations.

This entails developing approaches that do things such as:
self-supervised predictive learning for video event segmentation
commonsense reasoning to ground perception and prior knowledge
generative modeling for building knowledge from the ground-up

Much of my group's current work focuses on analyzing, modeling, and synthesizing complex video scenes and the semantic structure that can describe them. I also work on applying machine learning to other domains, such as IoTs We also work on use-inspired artificial intelligence research with applications in agriculture and animal diagnostics.
