Description: Saurabh Gupta

I am an Assistant Professor at UIUC. Before this, I was a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research in Pittsburgh working with Prof. Abhinav Gupta. Earlier, I was a Computer Science graduate student at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by Prof. Jitendra Malik. Even earlier, I was an under graduate at IIT Delhi, in India, where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering.

Prospective Students: I am looking for strong and motivated students to work with. If you are interested in working with me, please directly apply through the CS or ECE departments and mention my name. No GRE Needed! You do not need to directly contact me (and if you do, I am sorry that I may not be able to promptly respond back to you). If you are already at UIUC, please fill up this form and I will be in touch if and when I have an opening that will be a good fit for you.

Research

I work on computer vision, robotics and machine learning. I am interested in building agents that can intelligently interact with the physical world around them. I am currently focusing on two aspects: a) choice and design of representations that enable such interaction, and b) what and how to learn from active interaction. Some example problems that we are tackling include: building spatio-semantic and topological representations for visual navigation, skill discovery, learning for and from videos, and active visual learning.
