Description: Scott Aaronson


I'm Schlumberger Centennial Chair of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin, and director of its Quantum Information Center. My research interests center around the capabilities and limits of quantum computers, and computational complexity theory more generally.

For the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years, I'm on leave to work at OpenAI on the theoretical foundations of AI safety.

Information for Prospective PhD Students: At UT Austin, admissions are strictly through the yearly application process, not through emailing individual faculty members like me. I'm always on the lookout for great students, although funding is extremely tight this year. If you apply for a PhD in CS and specify that you want to work with me, I'll be sure to see your application. (I can also supervise or co-supervise physics students, but in that case I play no role in admissions.) Admissions are extremely competitive, so I urge you to apply broadly to maximize your chances.
