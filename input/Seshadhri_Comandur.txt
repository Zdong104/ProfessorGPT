Students, please read this before emailing.
I am on leave for the 2023-2024 academic year. I will likely decline most service requests and will be slow to respond to emails.


Brief Bio

C. Seshadhri (Sesh) is a professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz and an Amazon scholar. Prior to joining UCSC, he was a researcher at Sandia National Labs, Livermore in the Information Security Sciences department, during 2010-2014. His primary interest is the theoretical study of algorithms, especially those with a mix of graphs and randomization. By and large, Sesh works at the boundary of theoretical computer science (TCS) and data mining. His work spans many areas: sublinear algorithms, graph algorithms, graph modeling, scalable computation, and data mining. In the theory world, his work has resolved numerous open problems in monotonicity testing and graph property testing. A number of his papers in the interface of TCS and applied algorithms have received paper awards at KDD, WWW, ICDM, SDM, and WSDM. He received the 2019 SDM/IBM Early Career Award for Excellence in Data Analytics. Sesh got his Ph.D from Princeton University and spent two years as a postdoc in IBM Almaden Labs.

PTReview

Eric Blais, Sourav Chakraborty, and I started a blog called Property Testing Review, a monthly digest of property testing and sublinear algorithms papers. Currently, it is edited by Akash Kumar, Clement Canonne, and myself.
