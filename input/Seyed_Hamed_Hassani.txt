Hamed Hassani

I am an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering (primary) as well as the Department of Computer and Information Systems and Department of Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton Business School.

I am the Penn site-lead at EnCORE: Institute for Emerging CORE Methods of Data Science.

Before joining Penn, I was a research fellow at the Simons Institute, UC Berkeley (program: Foundations of Machine Learning). Prior to that, I was a post-doctoral scholar and lecturer in the Institute for Machine Learning at ETH Zürich. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer and Communication Sciences from EPFL. Here is my Curriculum Vitae.
