Short Bio
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. My research includes machine learning and Bayesian statistics for design and decision-making under uncertainty. Prior to Northeastern, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Systems Research at the University of Maryland. I received my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees both in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2016 and 2019 respectively. I hold a minor in Applied Statistics from the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University. I also received an M.Sc. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology in 2014 and a B.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2012.

 

Open Positions

I am looking for motivated Ph.D. students to join my group. The general areas of interest include machine learning, optimization, and Bayesian statistics. The candidates are expected to have strong backgrounds in programming, mathematics, and statistics. If interested, please contact me at f.ghoreishi@northeastern.edu and include your CV and transcripts.
