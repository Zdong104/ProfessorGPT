Hi! I am a professor in the CSE department in UC San Diego. I am part of the Theory of Computation group and help run the theory seminar.

I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science and mathematics. In particular computational complexity, randomness and pseudo-randomness, algebraic constructions, coding theory, additive combinatorics and high-dimensional geometry. My research is funded by NSF and a Simons investigator award.

If you are a student and would like me to write you a recommendation letter, please read this first.
