I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of the College of Computing & Informatics at Drexel University where I am part of the EconCS group. From 2013 to 2019, I was a PhD student in the Computer and Information Science Department at University of Pennsylvania where I was fortunate to be advised by Michael Kearns. For the following two years, I was a CRCS postdoctoral fellow in the Computer Science Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard. I was lucky to be hosted by Milind Tambe and was also affiliated with the EconCS group.

Research Interests

My main interests are in machine learning, game theory, and their intersection. These days, I mostly focus on the ethical aspects of algorithmic decision-making and think about how AI-driven technology can lead to positive societal impact.
If you are interested in working on any of these topics with me, please apply to our PhD program and mention me in your application.
