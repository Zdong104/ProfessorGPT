 Assistant Professor

 Dreese Lab 572 

 Department of Computer Science and Engineering

 The Ohio State University

 email: bojjavenkatakrishnan.2@osu.edu

I am an assistant professor in the computer science and engineering department at the Ohio State University. I am broadly interested in designing intelligent data-driven algorithms for current and emerging networking and distributed systems. In particular, I am interested in fundamental questions at the networking layer of blockchains and emerging large scale decentralized applications. I enjoy problems that warrant 'first-principles' thinking. Some of the other topics I have worked on in the past include scheduling algorithms for data center networks, peer-to-peer networks and information theory.  

Prior to my current position I was a postdoc in the networks and mobile systems group at MIT, where I worked on exciting problems in the intersection of network systems, algorithms and theory. I received my PhD from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2017. I did my bachelor's degree at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2012. During the summer of 2016 I interned at Google, where I worked on congestion control in Google's data center networks. I was a recipient of the Joan and Lalit Bahl fellowship at UIUC. 




Prospective Graduate Students: I am looking for motivated students interested in networking systems and/or machine learning (particularly reinforcement learning). If you are interested, please send me an email.
