Shandian Zhe

Assistant Professor

School of Computing, University of Utah

Office: Room 3466, MEB building

Address: 50 Central Campus Dr #3190, School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112

I obtained the Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department of Purdue University in 2017.

My research interests mainly lie in probabilistic machine learning. That is, using probabilistic frameworks to formulate learning problems and to infer/estimate model parameters. My research include but are not limited to probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian nonparametric, physics informed machine learning, approximate inference, sparse learning, large-scale machine learning and kernel methods. From application side, I have developed probabilistic methods for microarray data analysis, association study for Alzheimer's disease, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis, and click-through-rate prediction for online advertising.
