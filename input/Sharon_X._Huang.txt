Brief Bio:

Sharon Xiaolei Huang received her B.E. degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University, China, and her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Rutgers University. She is currently a Professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology and a member of the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. Her research interests are in the areas of biomedical image analysis, computer vision, and machine learning, focusing on methods for image and video segmentation, image and video synthesis, 3D computer vision, object recognition, computer-assisted diagnosis and intervention, registration/matching, and motion tracking. Her broader interests include artificial intelligence and data science for healthcare and biomedicine, biomedical informatics, computer graphics, visualization, and human-computer interaction. She regularly serves as an area chair and on the program committees of major conferences in medical image computing and computer vision and is an associate editor for several journals including Medical Image Analysis, and Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics. Her research has been funded by the NIH, NSF, DOE, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Pennsylvania state.

Research:

I am a computer scientist who is curious about how human brain, eye, body, and cell, function. Hence I am always excited about developing robust image analysis methods and building autonomous and intelligent systems that integrate algorithms with efficient, application-specific designs to solve computational problems in biomedicine, perception, and cognition. In particular, I work toward robust medical imaging software based on computer vision and machine learning algorithms that aid medical doctors in accurate and reproducible diagnosis, and help them better understand the anatomical and physiological relationships in normal and diseased states. I develop image processing and analysis software for analyzing biological images to help biologists and biophysicists in understanding and modeling complex biological pathways and systems. I also create intelligent vision systems that are capable of learning effectively and reasoning about multiple sources of information in order to achieve functions typical of human vision.
