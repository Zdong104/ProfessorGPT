Shashank Srivastava

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill, where I lead the Learning from Language Lab 

Email: ssrivastava@cs.unc.edu

I do research on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, with special interests in grounding language in perception, neuro-symbolic methods, and interactive machine learning. Previously, I was at Microsoft Research in Redmond. Even earlier, I was a graduate student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon. My dissertation research with Tom Mitchell focused on teaching machines new tasks through natural language supervision, and led a new direction of training machine learning models from language-based supervision. I organized the first workshop on Learning by Instruction at NeurIPS 2018, and have been co-organizing the DaSH workshops on human-in-the-loop learning.

I am broadly interested in machine intelligence, language, and story-telling. Once upon a time, I used to do bad things with other people's money at Tower Research Capital.
