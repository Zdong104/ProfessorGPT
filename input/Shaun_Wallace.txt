Description: Shaun Wallace
Univ. of Rhode Island

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island (URI). I lead the Human-Centered Experiential Technologies lab (HAX). My research starts with Human-Computer Interaction, and combines it with Systems, Data Science, Human-Centered AI, and Social Computing. I build public research systems as products to personalize and augment human information interactions. My research has been supported by The Readability Consortium, Adobe, Google, UCF, and NASA.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from Brown University, advised by Jeff Huang at the Brown HCI Group. I received my masters degree from the University of Limerick in Music Technology. I also received my undergraduate degree from the University of Rhode Island in Management Science and Information Systems. Before joining URI, I worked in industry for over 15 years from junior to lead roles developing full-stack web applications, distributed systems, and data services.
