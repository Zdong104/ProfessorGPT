Welcome to my UC Merced website

I conduct research in image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. I am particularly interested in images and videos that have location associated with them. Overhead imagers from satellite or aerial platforms are a traditional example. However, the advent of low-cost, small GPS recievers has broadened this. Unmaned aerial vehicles (more commonly known as drones) now represent another source of overhead images and videos. And, there are millions of photographs and movies taken from smart phones, etc. that have location information.

Knowing the location of these images and videos allows us to infer things about our Earth through image understanding. I develop fundamental image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition techniques to analyze these images and videos.

PhD POSITIONS AVAILABLE: Professor Newsam is looking to recruit well-qualified PhD students to start in fall 2018. For more information, please click here.
