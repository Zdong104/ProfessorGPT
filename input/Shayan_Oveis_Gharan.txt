A short bio and my CV

I am mainly interested in the design and analysis of algorithms using algebraic techniques.
I am looking for strong graduate students and Postdocs in theory of computing. If you are intersted in working with me take a look at my recent advanced courses Modern Spectral Graph Theory, The Polynomial Paradigm in Algorithms.
In Spring 2019 I co-organized a semester long program on Geometry of Polynomials. Here is a research vignette about my works on Log-concave polynomials with connections to the Geometry of Polynomials program.
