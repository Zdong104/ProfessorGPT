I am interested in using generative AI methods to solve biomedical problems:
Use off-the-shelf language models to solve biomedical problems. See BioTranslator, an intermediate layer that can translate between text data and bio data, which enables us to apply LMs (e.g., PubMedBERT) to non-text biodata.
Build large-scale pre-trained (language) model for biological data (e.g., Hi-C, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq).
See our recent Nature paper GigaPath. We use generative AI techniques to embed extremely large whole-slide pathology images (40,000 * 40,000 pixels!).
