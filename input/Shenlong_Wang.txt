I am an Assistant Professor at the UIUC Department of Computer Science, affiliated with Computer Vision @ UIUC, Illinois Robotics Group and Center for Immersive Computing @ UIUC. I finished my PhD at Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto and worked as a research scientist at Uber, advised by Raquel Urtasun.

My research interests lie at the intersection of 3D computer vision and robotics, particularly in two areas: (a) developing algorithms to perceive and model the 3D world, and (b) creating accurate, realistic, and physics-informed digital twins of objects and scenes. Our research group is exploring various topics within this field, such as robust and uncertainty-aware robot perception, modeling articulated objects from videos, generating 3D scenes and sensors through machine learning, developing safe autonomy for self-driving, and creating physics-informed simulations for immersive computing and climate change.
