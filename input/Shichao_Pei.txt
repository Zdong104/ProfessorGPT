I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston). My research interests broadly lie in machine learning and data mining, in particular graph representation learning, knowledge representation learning and reasoning, knowledge acquisition and integration, recommendation system, language models, data-efficient machine learning, etc.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University of Notre Dame. And I received my Ph.D. in computer science from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Dec. 2021, where I was part of the Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering (MINE) Lab in the Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), advised by Prof. Xiangliang Zhang. I also received my M.S. degree in computer science from KAUST in Dec. 2017. Before that, I obtained a B.Eng. in software engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, where my research began under the supervision of Prof. Chao Shen.

I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my research group. Please drop me an email if you are interested in working with me!
