Short Bio:

Dr. Shimei Pan is an Associate Professor at the Information Systems Department of UMBC. Before joining UMBC, Dr. Pan was a research scientist at IBM Watson Research Center in New York. Her primary research interests are  Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large-Scale Social Media Analytics and their applications in Human Behavior Modeling. She is also interested in fair AI/ML and Human-AI Interaction. Dr. Pan has authored 100+ peer-reviewed papers in major international conferences and journals. She has also served on the program committees for major international conferences (e.g.,  ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, IJCAI, IUI, CIKM and RecSys). She was the program co-chair of 2015 ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI), the conference co-chair of IUI 2019 and the program chair of IEEE ICTAI 2020.  Currently, she is an associate editor of ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS) and a member of the steering committee of IUI. Dr. Shimei Pan received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Columbia University.
