About
Shiqing Ma is an Assistant Professor in the Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences (CICS) at University of Massachusetts Amherst. He was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University from September 2019 to June 2023. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University in 2019 and B.E. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2013. His research focuses on improving the transparency of modern computing systems, which is an intersection of security, AI, and software systems. He is the recipient of Distinguished Paper Awards from NDSS 2016 and USENIX Security 2017, and the NSF CAREER award.
