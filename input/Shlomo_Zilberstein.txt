Shlomo Zilberstein is Professor of Computer Science and Associate Dean for Research and Engagement in the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He also directs the Resource-Bounded Reasoning Lab. He received a B.A. in Computer Science summa cum laude from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley.

Zilberstein’s research focuses on the foundations and applications of resource-bounded reasoning techniques, which allow complex systems to make decisions while coping with uncertainty, missing information, and limited computational resources. His research interests include decision theory, reasoning under uncertainty, Markov decision processes, design of autonomous agents, heuristic search, real-time problem solving, principles of meta-reasoning, planning and scheduling, multi-agent systems, automated coordination and communication, information gathering, and reinforcement learning.

Zilberstein is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). He is recipient of the University of Massachusetts Chancellor’s Medal (2019), the IFAAMAS Influential Paper Award (2019), the AAAI Distinguished Service Award (2019), a National Science Foundation CAREER Award (1996), and the Israel Defense Prize (1992). He received Paper Awards from ECAI (1998), AAMAS (2003), IAT (2005), MSDM (2008), ICAPS (2010), and AAAI (2017, 2021), IEEE BigData (2020), IJCAI (2020), and SoCS (2022), and the Lady Davis Visiting Professorship at the Technion (2000). He is the past Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Associate Editor of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems and Multi-Agent Systems, and Member of the Editorial Board of Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence. He served as Chair of the Conference Committee of the AAAI Conference (AAAI-17, AAAI-16, AAAI-15) and Program Chair of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS-15, ICAPS-04), and the International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM-06). He is the former President of ICAPS, a former Councilor of AAAI, a current Trustee of IJCAI, and the Chairman of the AI Access Foundation.
