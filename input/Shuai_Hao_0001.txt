Short Bio



I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Old Dominion University (ODU), Norfolk, VA. I am also affiliated with ODU's School of Cybersecurity. Prior to joining ODU, I worked as a Postdoc Researcher in the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) at University of California San Diego, working with Dr. Alberto Dainotti and Dr. Amogh Dhamdhere. I obtained my Ph.D. from Department of Computer Science at the College of William and Mary, advised by Dr. Haining Wang.



[2019/06] Starting Fall 2019, I will be a tenure-track assistant professor in Department of Computer Science at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA.

[2018/01] I am joining CAIDA at UC San Diego as a Postdoctoral Researcher.

[2017/11] I defended my Ph.D. from College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA.

[2017/09] I am working as a Research Intern in Computer Security Department at NEC Laboratories America in Princeton, New Jersey.

Research

My research interest lies in Networking and Security, with the specific focus on applying measurement, empirical study, and data-driven approach to study Internet Infrastructure (Topology, Routing, DNS, CDN, etc.), Security and Privacy of Internet and Networking Systems, Web Security and Privacy, and Cybercrime.
