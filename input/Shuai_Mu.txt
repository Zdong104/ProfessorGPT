I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at Stony Brook University. My main research interests are in distributed systems and multi-core systems. I’m particularly interested in:

Building fault-tolerant storage and database systems.
Building tools to ease concurrent programming for developers.
Verifying correctness of distributed systems and algorithms.

I am looking for motivated PhD/MS/Undergrad students. If you are interested, email me a brief resume.
