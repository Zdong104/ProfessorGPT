I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research interests are in security and privacy, particularly using data-driven analytics and machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks and malicious activities. My current work focuses on machine learning security, big data security, and security of next-generation network systems.

I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2022), IETF Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP 2020), IEEE/IFIP DSN Best Paper Award (2020), IMC Best Paper Award Runner-up (2019), Top 10 Finalist of CSAW Best Applied Security Paper Award (2022, 2017), and Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges Program Award (2012).

I completed my undergraduate study at Tsinghua University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology advised by Prof. Nick Feamster. I also worked closely with Prof. Vern Paxson at the University of California, Berkeley/ICSI. Before joining the University of Texas at Dallas, I was a postdoc at the University of California, Santa Barbara working with Prof. Giovanni Vigna and Prof. Christopher Kruegel.

RA positions available: I am looking for self-motivated PhD students who have strong interests in machine learning, data analytics, and cybersecurity research. If you are interested, feel free to send me an email.
