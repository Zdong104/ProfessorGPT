about me

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and co-direct UCI's Interactive Graphics & Visualization Lab (iGravi). Before joining UCI, I was a postdoctoral associate at MIT. I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science from Cornell University in 2014. I received the NSF CAREER award in 2023.

My group works mainly in physics-based computer graphics and scientific computing with a focus on modeling and simulating light transport in complex environments. Additionally, we aim to develop efficient solutions to the inverse problems centered around the inference of geometric or material properties from physical or simulated measurements.

Perspective students/visitors: If you are interested in working with me, please check this page.
