I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of smart environments and cyber-physical systems (CPS), particularly in building software and architectural support for enabling large-scale analytics on pervasive sensing devices. My research has enabled ubiquitous devices to expand their role and innovate new services, ranging from large-scale video analytics to pedestrian safety. I am also interested in using wearable sensors for enabling low-cost scalable monitoring of health parameters.

Prior to this (Fall 2017 - Summer 2020), I was an Assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Old Dominion University. I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Winlab, Rutgers University, in June 2017.

I am looking for motivated PhD students to join my research group! Send me an email with your CV and a short statement of research interests, if you're interested. Â
