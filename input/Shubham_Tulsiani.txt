Description: Shubham Tulsiani
I am an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Robotics Institute, where I am a part of the Computer Vision group. I am interested in building perception systems that can infer the spatial and physical structure of the world they observe. Please see these recent talks for an overview.




Prior to joining CMU, I was a Research Scientist at FAIR, Pittsburgh working with Abhinav Gupta. I previously graduated from UC, Berkeley where I was advised by Jitendra Malik, and also frequently collaborated with Alyosha Efros.

Research Group


Our group is interested in inferring physically and spatially grounded representations from perceptual input, and leveraging these for advances in fundamental problems in computer vision and robot manipulation. We believe that to enable machines to understand the physical world, we should reduce the reliance on supervision by annotation, and instead develop learning mechanisms informed by the real, physical world we live in – by incorporating our knowledge about its structure and laws as a 'meta-supervisory' signal.

If you are interested in joining our group, please read this.
