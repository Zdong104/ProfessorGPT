Welcome to my personal homepage

My name is Shubhra Kanti Karmaker (“Santu”). I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University, Alabama. My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. Before joining Auburn University, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), hosted by Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni.

During my Ph.D., I also worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research (Summer 2017 and 2018), Yahoo Research (Summer 2016), and @WalmartLabs (Summer 2015).
