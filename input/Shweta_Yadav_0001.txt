Shweta Yadav

Computer Science , University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), IL, USA.

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). Previously, I served as a Bridge to the Faculty (B2F) fellow in the Computer Science (CS) Department at UIC. I have also worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH). I earned my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Healthcare-informatics, Biomedical Text Mining, and Computational Social Science. I aim to develop effective and efficient machine learning algorithms to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence in the healthcare and medical domains. I have a strong commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration and have experience working on emerging real-world problems in healthcare and social sciences.

My current research works focus on developing computational methods for medical document summarization, disease progression, and prediction of health outcomes from electronic health records and social media.

EDarkFind: Unsupervised Multi-View Learning for Sybil Account Detection
Ramnath Kumar, Shweta Yadav, Raminta Daniulaityte, Francois Lamy, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Usha Lokala, and Amit Sheth

Darknet crypto markets are online marketplaces using crypto currencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Monero) and advanced encryption techniques to offer anonymity to vendors and consumers trading for illegal goods or services. The exact volume of substances advertised and sold through these crypto markets is difficult to assess, at least partially, because vendors tend to maintain multiple accounts (or Sybil accounts) within and across different crypto markets. Linking these different accounts will allow us to accurately evaluate the volume of substances advertised across the different crypto markets by each vendor. In this paper, we present a multi-view unsupervised framework (eDarkFind) that helps modeling vendor characteristics and facilitates Sybil account detection. We employ a multi-view learning paradigm to generalize and improve the performance by exploiting the diverse views from multiple rich sources such as BERT, stylometric, and location representation. Our model is further tailored to take advantage of domain-specific knowledge such as the Drug Abuse Ontology to take into consideration the substance information. We performed extensive experiments and demonstrated that the multiple views obtained from diverse sources can be effective in linking Sybil accounts. Our proposed eDarkFind model achieves an accuracy of 98% on three real-world datasets which shows the generality of the approach.
