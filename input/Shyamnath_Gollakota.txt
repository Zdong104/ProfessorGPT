Head of the Mobile Intelligence Lab


Co-leading the TUNE project

Co-founder of Wavely Diagnostics


My inter-disciplinary group spans computer scientists, electrical, mechanical & aerospace engineers, biologists and physicians. We are driven by our curiosity to tackle hard technical and societal problems. We do not constrain ourselves with the boundaries of traditional research disciplines and instead go wherever the problems take us. We work across machine learning, signal processing and hardware to build intelligent systems that previously were not thought possible. Our work has been licensed by ResMed Inc, and is in use by millions of users. Our startup Sound Life Sciences was acquired by Google. I was also CEO of a startup where we obtained FDA 510(k) clearance for the technology developed in my lab. We also worked closely with the Washington Department of Agriculture to wirelessly track invasive "murder" hornets, which resulted in the destruction of the first nest in the United States.

Inventions from my lab


My lab has made multiple inventions including battery-free computers that float in the wind, origami microfliers, ambient backscatter, Wi-Fi sensing and imaging, acoustic swarms, battery-free phones, active sonar on smart devices and Internet of bio-inspired and biological things. We also created various computing tools for medical diagnostics like contactless breathing, cardiac arrest and irregular heart rhythm monitoring, blood clot and ear infection testing using smartphones and new-born hearing screening using earbuds.

We are currently working on augmenting the human auditory perception with artificial intelligence to create enhanced human capabilities like semantic hearing and target speech hearing that have until now been in the realm of science fiction. We recently introduced knowledge boosting that enables collaboration between small and large deep learning models during low-latency inference. We have also been intrigued by the dynamics in human conversations and introduced the concept of target conversation extraction.
