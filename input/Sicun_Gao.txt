Research

I work on practical algorithms for NP-hard search and optimization problems that arise in the decision, control, and design aspects of computational systems.
The end goal is to build useful forms of automation and autonomy that are fundamentally reliable yet aggressively optimized.
Colloquially, I spend much time dealing with the curse of dimensionality and finding needles in haystacks.
