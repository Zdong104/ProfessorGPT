About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Go 49ers!!

At UNC-Charlotte, I direct the Network Analytics and Social Computing Lab (NASCL) [webpage under construction]. I am also an affiliate faculty member of the Complex Systems Instiute and the School of Data Science.

I received a Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech. Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I obtained an M.S. (Computer Science) from the Computer Science department at Florida State University. So I guess I am a Seminole first and then a Hokie!
I attended Sri Sathya Sai Univesity in India, where I obtained an integrated B.S./M.S. in Mathematics.

Research Interests

How do memes spread on Facebook? How and when does a hashtag become popular? Can we forecast/predict viral content? How can we harness information cascades to make 'real-world' predictions? I am broadly interested in web-mining, data analytics, computational social science, and applied machine learning with a primary emphasis on analyzing, characterizing, and forecasting information (news, rumors, memes, advertisements, etc.) dynamics on online social networks & social media. Furthermore, my research aims to leverage dynamical processes (like cascade propagation) to build explanatory & predictive models of actions of large groups of people and societies.
