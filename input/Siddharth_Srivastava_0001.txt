Research areas: ¬† ¬† Generalizable planning and learning in AI and Robotics, AI assessment

My research focuses on principles and algorithms for reliable AI systems that can carry out generalizable planning and learning to solve complex, user-desired tasks. My group is currently working on topics such as learning abstraction hierachies, transfer learning, learning representations for sequential decision-making and on new paradigms for third-party safety and capability assessment of AI systems that can learn and plan. We are particularly interested in developing principles for AI systems that can reliably (and safely) learn, generalize and transfer knowledge to solve new, user-desired tasks not encountered during training.


Check out my group's webpage to learn more about our research!


Student opportunities: If you are interested in joining my group, please send me an email with your CV, a copy of your transcript, and a note on how you might contribute to some of our projects. If you have done well in technically rigorous classes in AI, or mathematics, or CS theory, you are already off to a great start!

Learning abstractions for RL in non-image-based tasks is hard.

We were surprised to find that learning a conditional abstraction tree (CAT) while doing RL can improve sample efficiency to the point where vanilla Q-learning can outperform SOTA RL methods. #UAI2023

Happy to share a new class of algorithms for generalized planning: https://t.co/wOLOj2F8sH
The paper addresses a key problem in computing general plans/policies: will a given generalized plan terminate/reach good states? This is unsolvable in general due to the halting problem. pic.twitter.com/aUXn2MfBNi

Our #NeurIPS2022 paper develops a new approach for few-shot learning of generalized policy automata (GPA) for relational stochastic shortest path planning problems.

The learned GPAs can be used to transfer learning and accelerate SSP solvers on much larger problem instances! pic.twitter.com/dRp5sZNeps

We‚Äôd like AI systems to continually learn and adapt, but how would a user figure out what their black-box AI (BBAI) system can safely do at any point?
This is difficult especially when the user and the BBAI use different representations. Our #KR2022 work addresses this problem. pic.twitter.com/0hzhk7QNZ0

‚Äî Siddharth Srivastava (@sidsrivast) July 31, 2022

Reliable planning and learning in problems without image-based state representations remains challenging. In our #IJCAI2022 work we found that doing an abstraction before learning results in generalized Q functions and zero-shot transfer to much larger problems!

Consider submitting your recent work on generalization/transfer in all forms of planning and sequential decision making! Due ~today, May 20th in NeurIPS or IJCAI format https://t.co/1DHcFEcFIt

Congratulations to @shah_naman, @pulkit_verma, Trevor Angle and the entire dev team for creating JEDAI and winning the Best Demo Award @aamas2022! üéâ
JEDAI (JEDAI explains decision-making AI) is an interactive learning tool for AI+robotics that provides explanations autonomously.

Task and motion planning (TAMP) captures the essence of what we want robots to be able to do in a range of settings. But cobots need to communicate with humans to avoid potential conflicts. Our #ICRA2022 work develops a unified framework for integrating communication with TAMP. pic.twitter.com/ObVDkWSZtZ

We use hand-coded state and action abstractions extensively in AI planning. Where do these abstractions come from? Our #aamas2022 paper develops methods for learning such abstractions from scratch and for using them to solve robot planning problems efficiently and reliably.üóùÔ∏èü•°üëá pic.twitter.com/lp3U8rpK6R

Can we assess what Black-Box #AI systems can and can‚Äôt do reliably as they change/adapt to changing situations?

In our #AAAI2022 paper, @pulkit_verma and @rashmeet_nayyar (= contributors) address this with the foundations for efficient /differential/ assessment of AI systems. pic.twitter.com/5xmOmSS8XL

‚Äî Siddharth Srivastava (@sidsrivast) December 3, 2021

Excited to be a part of the workshop on Generalization in Planning (GenPlan) at IJCAI '21!

We welcome current/recent work on the synthesis or learning of plans and policies with an emphasis on generalizability and transfer.

Submission deadline: May 9.https://t.co/bfwxUGXXqm

Imagine a robot doing your laundry or making a cup of tea for you. #ASUEngineering @CIDSEASU assistant professor @sidsrivast is working to equip #artificialintelligence with the capability to do real-world tasks. #AI https://t.co/RrcfGUP0wr

Can we use #DeepLearning to speed up robot planning while maintaining theoretical guarantees (correctness, probabilistic completeness)? Dan and Kislay's work indicates YES, but with a few changes to planning algorithms. Check it out at https://t.co/tu7TSRcwBT and @icra20 online! pic.twitter.com/fQQ13qyzwJ

Congrats to Daniel, Naman, Kislay, Deepak & Pranav for their first papers, accepted at #ICRA2020! Their #NSF_CISE funded #AI research shows how to compute reliable robot plans more efficiently using (1)abstractions & (2)#DeepLearning. Camera-readies coming soon! #ICRA #NSFfunded

How can we train people to use adaptive #AI systems, whose behavior and functionality is expected to change from day to day? Our approach: make the AI system self-explaining! #ASUFoW https://t.co/VwFs30sJU2

As anyone who has talked to a 3yo knows, explaining why something can‚Äôt be done can be much harder than explaining a solution. Can #AI systems explain why they failed to solve a given problem? Sarath's new work takes first steps in explaining unsolvability https://t.co/lQuRSeKc4b

‚Äî Siddharth Srivastava (@sidsrivast) March 27, 2019

Dan and Kislay's new work on motion planning tries to get the best of both worlds: the learn and link planner (LLP) learns and improves with experience. It is also sound and probabilistically complete. Check out the results here: https://t.co/v21OfXJgtB

Our new work aims at allowing designers and users to choose whether their AI systems clarify, or protect information.
