Beyond knowing how things are,
There is no other understanding.

A Song on the Six Perfections, Milarepa

I am an associate professor in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell, as well as a field member in Departments of Computer Science, ECE, and the Center for Applied Mathematics.

I work on topics at the intersection of data-driven decision-making and stochastic control, economics and computation, and large-scale network algorithms. Some of my current research interests include:

New data-driven approaches for online decision-making [seminar]
Non-monetary mechanisms and information design [seminar]
Equity and fairness in online decision-making [seminar]
Stochastic coupling techniques in control (tutorial: [part 1], [part 2])

Prior to Cornell, I received my PhD from the ECE Department at UT Austin, and was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford MS&E. I also served as technical consultant at Lyft in 2014-18, where I helped develop and implement Lyft’s primetime pricing; the following tutorial and book chapter give an overview of my work on ridesharing platforms.

I am currently on sabbatical at the Simons Institute in Berkeley as a co-organizer of the program on Data-Driven Decision-Making.

Again and as always,
and as seen above
there are no questions more urgent
than the naive ones.

And the point is, to live everything.
Live the questions now.
Perhaps then someday far in the future,
you will gradually, without noticing,
live your way into the answer.

We shall not cease from exploration
and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started
and know the place for the first time.

Don't worry about the overall importance of the problem;
work on it if it looks interesting.
I think there's probably a sufficient correlation
between interest and importance.
