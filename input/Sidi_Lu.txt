Greetings! I am Sidi Lu. My general research interests span edge computing, emerging mobility, and applied AI & data science (especially at the intersection of machine learning and networked, distributed, and autonomous systems), aiming to make computer systems (e.g., connected vehicles and IoT devices) more reliable, scalable, secure, and efficient. All my research projects are steered by imperfect real-world datasets with varying quality and inconsistent data frequencies, centering around solving practical problems by transferring, improving, and delivering AI and system solutions from the lab to production, even in unfamiliar and challenging conditions.

My PhD academic advisor is Prof. Weisong Shi. I have joined in William & Mary since August 2023. Specifically, my work delves into the real-world deployment and comprehensive assessment of cutting-edge technologies on resource-constrained devices, such as vehicles, edge servers, and sensors. Besides, I also focus on fostering collaborative learning among these devices, incorporating both horizontal collaborations (e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle and edge-to-edge) and vertical or cross-layer ones (e.g., vehicle-to-edge and vehicle-edge-cloud). To provide a more precise understanding, my research directions primarily revolves around two exciting domains: (1) vehicle computing: encompassing topics such as connected vehicles, software-defined vehicles, autonomous driving, electric vehicles, and drones; (2) edge intelligence: including IoT applications, smart manufacturing, smart home, connected health, augmented/virtual reality, etc.

 I am looking for multiple Ph.D. students and (remote) research assistants (undergraduate and master's students) who would be a good match, or who could bring complementary expertise! However, please read "my advice for prospective students" first.
 If you are interested in working with me, please submit this Google form, and apply for admission to William & Mary.
 In case Google-based services are inaccessible to you, please drop me an email and include your answers to questions regarding "what, why, and how" (see my advice above for more info) at sidi@wm.edu with the subject line “[Position] Application - [Full Name]".

Research Experience
2022-2023

[12] Implementation and Evaluation of an Edge Computing Framework for Connected Vehicles

Collaborate with Nokia Bell Lab and Northwestern University

My role: Project leader

·The proposed Vehicle-EdgeServer-Cloud (VEC) framework is fully evaluated using our designed roadside platform and outdoor delivery vehicle.

·Our framework has a potential of 18× reduction on the bandwidth requirement, i.e., it can work stably with limited bandwidth of around 320KB/s. This demonstrates its extremely promising applications for connected vehicles (CVs).

 

2021-2022

[11] Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Video Compressive Sensing

Collaborate with Nokia Bell Lab and Northwestern University

My role: Project leader

·When employing object detection models on the compressed video images, a higher compression ratio (B) is desired to obtain faster inference speed and less transmission costs. However, there is a significant trade-off between B, detection accuracy, and the quality of the reconstructed video.

·One research gap in previous studies is how to adapt the compression ratio under different scenarios. We fill this gap utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) and various DNNs to automatically choose optimal B for different application scenarios. This work takes the technology one step further towards real applications of compressive images.

 

2022

[10] Teleoperation Technologies for Enhancing Connected and Autonomous Vehicles

Research Assistant at Wayne State University

My role: Project leader

·Fully autonomous driving is not yet completely feasible. Teleoperation promises to be an important interim solution for bridging the gap between current autonomous driving capabilities and the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, where a remote operator can supervise vehicles with manual intervention via wireless communication.

·We explore technical considerations, enhancement techniques, evaluation criteria, and summarize research efforts of automotive participants and teleoperation use cases.

Zenlayer – The CAR Lab Official Collaboration

My role: Project leader

·Develop automatic cross-layer computing scheduling approaches for the whole stack from the distributed and heterogeneous infrastructure (i.e., Bare Metal clusters) to the virtual machine/container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) and all the way to applications (e.g., games and short videos).

 

2021-2022

[8] A comparison of End-to-End Architectures for Connected Vehicles

Toyota InfoTeach Labs - The CAR Lab Official Collaboration

My role: Project leader

·Examine different types of architectures for vehicle computing, including centralized architecture, decentralized architecture, publish/subscribe architecture, and broadcast architecture.

·Classify essential vehicle applications and discuss their performance requirements (e.g., communication mode, critical latency, data rate per vehicle, and communication range).

·Choose software over-the-air (OTA) update as our case study and propose an edge-based architecture for connected vehicles, named EdgeArC.

 

2020-2021

[7] SafeCampus: Multimodal-based Campus-wide Pandemic Forecasting

Research assistant at Wayne State University

My role: Project leader

·Build a multimodal-based COVID-19 pandemic forecasting platform steering by video, audio, and tweets for Wayne State University to minimize the impact of COVID-19 after resuming academic activities.

·Train diverse models to extract meaningful information from video, audio, and tweets by i) detecting and counting face masks, ii) detecting and counting cough for potential infected cases, and iii) conducting sentiment analysis based on COVID-19 related tweets.

·Fed the multimodal analysis results together with daily confirmed cases data and social distancing metrics into the LSTM model to predict the daily increase rate of confirmed cases for the next seventh day.

 

2021

[6] The Emergency of Vehicle Computing

Research Assistant at Wayne State University

My role: Project leader (vision paper)

·With the proliferation of onboard computing and communication capabilities, we envision that connected vehicles will be serving as a mobile computing platform in addition to their conventional transportation role for the next century.

·We also discuss vehicle computing from several aspects, including several case studies, key enabling technologies, a potential business model, a general computing framework, and open challenges.

 

2020-2021

[5] Lane Detection/Prediction Enhancement under Challenging Scenarios

Intern project in GM

My role: Project leader

·Focus on the lane detection/prediction enhancement under challenging scenarios with severe occlusion and extreme lighting conditions (e.g., rainy and snowy days) when the perception system of the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) loses the lane detection and urgently needs higher-level semantic analysis of lane markings.

2019-2020

[4] Integrated Vehicle-EdgeServer-Cloud Framework for Compressive Imaging Processing

Nokia Bell Lab – The CAR Lab Official Collaboration

My role: Project leader

·Introduce the technologies of temporal compressive sensing into the connected vehicle applications. which provides a new and novel direction to achieve faster video processing by executing models on optically compressed video images, i.e., a small number of linear projections of the original video images.

·Experiment results proved that the detection accuracy on the compressed video images (named measurements) is close to the accuracy on reconstructed videos and comparable to the true value, which proves the effectiveness of employing DNN models on the compressed video images. This is the first work that provides a new direction to achieve fast DNN inference.



2019-2020

[3] Collaborative Learning on the Edges

Research assistant at Wayne State University

My role: Project leader

·Propose a collaborative learning framework on the edges, dubbed CLONE. Two application scenarios for CLONE were explored, including CLONE in the training stage (CLONE_training) and CLONE in the inference stage (CLONE_inference).

·Distributed Electric Vehicle Battery Failure Prediction: As to CLONE_training, we choose the failure of electric vehicle (EV) battery and associated accessories as our case study to show how the collaborative framework can accurately predict failures to ensure sustainable and reliable driving in a collaborative fashion.

·Multi-target Multi-camera Tracking: As to CLONE_inference, we choose multi-target multi-camera tracking as another case study to prove that the collaborative framework can also keep tracking customers based on eight different cameras in a grocery store.

 

2019-2020

[2] Extensible and Flexible Middleware for Edge Service

Research assistant at Wayne State University

My role: Project leader

·Propose an extensible and flexible middleware to manage the execution of vehicle services, with four key features: i) on-demand model switch, ii) function consolidation and deduplication to eliminate duplicate copies of repeating functions and maximize the reusability of vehicle services, iii) build event-driven applications to reduce workload, and iv) dynamic workflow customization which enables customizing workflow to extend the functionality.

·Our experiment results show that EdgeWare accelerates the execution of services about 2.6× faster compared to the silo approach and save CPU and memory utilization up to around 50% and 17% respectively.

 

2016-2018

[1] Disk Failure Prediction

Collaborate with Northeastern University

My role: Project leader

·This study covers the disk and server data measured and collected at a large data center. Over, the dataset spans over 64 data center sites, 10,000 server racks and 380,000 hard disks for roughly 70 days. This corresponds to roughly 2.6 million device hours.

·We discovered that performance metrics are good indicators of disk failures and location markers can improve the accuracy of disk failure prediction.

·We also train machine learning models including neural network models to predict disk failures with 0.95 F-measure and 0.95 MCC for 10 days prediction horizon.

Advices

So, you're thinking about joining my research group? Welcome! Before you hit 'send' on that application form or email, let's have a little chat about what I want to know about you! (Spoiler alert: it's not just about grades! I value your personality, ability, and potential).

When reaching out, I'm particularly interested in three key things - what, why, and how:

1. What makes you a unique or fit candidate? Of course, you can tell me your school, the classes you took, your GPA, and the programming languages you're proficient in. But beyond that, I'm more curious about what makes you stand out from the crowd of applicants with great GPAs and shiny diplomas: I want to know your technical abilities (e.g., writing solid code, publishing papers in international conferences, and having research experience) and personal traits (e.g., being a fast learner, diligent, detail-oriented, and skilled at observing and summarizing problems). Don't just list your awesomeness; try to impress me with examples of your achievements that showcase your distinctive characteristics.

2. Why do you want to work with me? Sure, you might be reaching out to multiple professors, but mass-emailing generic messages and simply copy-pasting professors’ paper titles won't win hearts. Instead, take some time to explore my research and identify the research directions that genuinely spark your interest. Remember, your research interests may impact and shape your entire career, so make sure you understand my work and how it aligns with your aspirations. Let's ensure we're a good match or complement one another in research.

3. How do you envision your first research project in my team? In other words, what do you want to do? If you're new to the research realm, no worries! Take a moment to consider the projects that align with your skills or tackle issues you deem highly significant. I’m eager to know how you think, even if your thoughts are still a bit vague! Plus, it help me better support you throughout your thrilling Ph.D. journey.





Expected candidates:

·         Major: Computer Science, Data Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Transportation Engineering, or other related fields.

·         Solid coding skills in machine learning frameworks (such as Pytorch and TensorFlow).

·         Strong passion for doing good research.




What will I offer?

·         Hands-on research experience, plus funding and travel supports for all PhD students.

·         Treat my students as my colleagues (not worker bees; you are tomorrow's top researchers and award winners).

·         Research collaborations with prestigious research groups in both academia and industry.

·         Internship opportunities in the high-tech industry.




Interested in joining?

·         Interested candidates are strongly encouraged to apply for admission to William & Mary and fill out this Google form.

·         If Google-based services have not been available to you, please follow my advice above and drop me an email at sidi@wm.edu with the subject line “[Position] Application - [Full Name].”




Graduate application deadlines:

·         For Fall admission: March 1 (to be considered for financial aid), March 15 (for international applicants who need a visa to travel to the US), June 1 (for all other applicants).

·         For Spring admission: October 1 (for all applicants).

·         There is no strict minimum threshold for TOEFL or GRE scores. Starting fall 2021, GRE scores are optional.
