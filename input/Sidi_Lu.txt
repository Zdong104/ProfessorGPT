Greetings! I am Sidi Lu. My general research interests span edge computing, emerging mobility, and applied AI & data science (especially at the intersection of machine learning and networked, distributed, and autonomous systems), aiming to make computer systems (e.g., connected vehicles and IoT devices) more reliable, scalable, secure, and efficient. All my research projects are steered by imperfect real-world datasets with varying quality and inconsistent data frequencies, centering around solving practical problems by transferring, improving, and delivering AI and system solutions from the lab to production, even in unfamiliar and challenging conditions.

My PhD academic advisor is Prof. Weisong Shi. I have joined in William & Mary since August 2023. Specifically, my work delves into the real-world deployment and comprehensive assessment of cutting-edge technologies on resource-constrained devices, such as vehicles, edge servers, and sensors. Besides, I also focus on fostering collaborative learning among these devices, incorporating both horizontal collaborations (e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle and edge-to-edge) and vertical or cross-layer ones (e.g., vehicle-to-edge and vehicle-edge-cloud). To provide a more precise understanding, my research directions primarily revolves around two exciting domains: (1) vehicle computing: encompassing topics such as connected vehicles, software-defined vehicles, autonomous driving, electric vehicles, and drones; (2) edge intelligence: including IoT applications, smart manufacturing, smart home, connected health, augmented/virtual reality, etc.

 I am looking for multiple Ph.D. students and (remote) research assistants (undergraduate and master's students) who would be a good match, or who could bring complementary expertise! However, please read "my advice for prospective students" first.
 If you are interested in working with me, please submit this Google form, and apply for admission to William & Mary.
 In case Google-based services are inaccessible to you, please drop me an email and include your answers to questions regarding "what, why, and how" (see my advice above for more info) at sidi@wm.edu with the subject line ‚Äú[Position] Application - [Full Name]".

[12] Implementation and Evaluation of an Edge Computing Framework for Connected Vehicles

Collaborate with Nokia Bell Lab and Northwestern University

My role: Project leader

¬∑The proposed Vehicle-EdgeServer-Cloud (VEC) framework is fully evaluated using our designed roadside platform and outdoor delivery vehicle.

¬∑Our framework has a potential of 18√ó reduction on the bandwidth requirement, i.e., it can work stably with limited bandwidth of around 320KB/s. This demonstrates its extremely promising applications for connected vehicles (CVs).

2021-2022

[11] Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Video Compressive Sensing

Collaborate with Nokia Bell Lab and Northwestern University

My role: Project leader

¬∑When employing object detection models on the compressed video images, a higher compression ratio (B) is desired to obtain faster inference speed and less transmission costs. However, there is a significant trade-off between B, detection accuracy, and the quality of the reconstructed video.

¬∑One research gap in previous studies is how to adapt the compression ratio under different scenarios. We fill this gap utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) and various DNNs to automatically choose optimal B for different application scenarios. This work takes the technology one step further towards real applications of compressive images.

2019-2020

[4] Integrated Vehicle-EdgeServer-Cloud Framework for Compressive Imaging Processing

Nokia Bell Lab ‚Äì The CAR Lab Official Collaboration

My role: Project leader

¬∑Introduce the technologies of temporal compressive sensing into the connected vehicle applications. which provides a new and novel direction to achieve faster video processing by executing models on optically compressed video images, i.e., a small number of linear projections of the original video images.

¬∑Experiment results proved that the detection accuracy on the compressed video images (named measurements) is close to the accuracy on reconstructed videos and comparable to the true value, which proves the effectiveness of employing DNN models on the compressed video images. This is the first work that provides a new direction to achieve fast DNN inference.



2019-2020

[3] Collaborative Learning on the Edges

Research assistant at Wayne State University

My role: Project leader

¬∑Propose a collaborative learning framework on the edges, dubbed CLONE. Two application scenarios for CLONE were explored, including CLONE in the training stage (CLONE_training) and CLONE in the inference stage (CLONE_inference).

¬∑Distributed Electric Vehicle Battery Failure Prediction: As to CLONE_training, we choose the failure of electric vehicle (EV) battery and associated accessories as our case study to show how the collaborative framework can accurately predict failures to ensure sustainable and reliable driving in a collaborative fashion.

¬∑Multi-target Multi-camera Tracking: As to CLONE_inference, we choose multi-target multi-camera tracking as another case study to prove that the collaborative framework can also keep tracking customers based on eight different cameras in a grocery store.

Advices

So, you're thinking about joining my research group? Welcome! Before you hit 'send' on that application form or email, let's have a little chat about what I want to know about you! (Spoiler alert: it's not just about grades! I value your personality, ability, and potential).

When reaching out, I'm particularly interested in three key things - what, why, and how:

1. What makes you a unique or fit candidate? Of course, you can tell me your school, the classes you took, your GPA, and the programming languages you're proficient in. But beyond that, I'm more curious about what makes you stand out from the crowd of applicants with great GPAs and shiny diplomas: I want to know your technical abilities (e.g., writing solid code, publishing papers in international conferences, and having research experience) and personal traits (e.g., being a fast learner, diligent, detail-oriented, and skilled at observing and summarizing problems). Don't just list your awesomeness; try to impress me with examples of your achievements that showcase your distinctive characteristics.

2. Why do you want to work with me? Sure, you might be reaching out to multiple professors, but mass-emailing generic messages and simply copy-pasting professors‚Äô paper titles won't win hearts. Instead, take some time to explore my research and identify the research directions that genuinely spark your interest. Remember, your research interests may impact and shape your entire career, so make sure you understand my work and how it aligns with your aspirations. Let's ensure we're a good match or complement one another in research.

3. How do you envision your first research project in my team? In other words, what do you want to do? If you're new to the research realm, no worries! Take a moment to consider the projects that align with your skills or tackle issues you deem highly significant. I‚Äôm eager to know how you think, even if your thoughts are still a bit vague! Plus, it help me better support you throughout your thrilling Ph.D. journey.
