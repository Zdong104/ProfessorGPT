Bio

I am an Associate Professor, and was an Assistant Professor from 2016 Aug - 2023 May.
I obtained my PhD (2010-2016) from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago under the supervision of Prof.Philip S. Yu.
I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the School of Software Engineering at Sun Yat-Sen University in 2004 and 2008, respectively.
