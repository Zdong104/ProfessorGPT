SOME GREAT MOMENTS











































	
RECENT RESEARCH TOPICS

Attention Decomposition for Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation

	
We address cross-domain semantic segmentation with a new transformer that reduces the gap between the source and target domains by decomposing cross-attention in the decoder into domain-independent and domain-specific parts. This enforces the query tokens to interact with domain-independent aspects of the image tokens, shared by the source and target domains, rather than domain-specific counterparts which induce the domain gap.

Markov Game Video Augmentation for Action Segmentation

	
For training, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to augment videos in the deep feature space rather than the visual spatiotemporal domain. RL is suitable since there are no reliable oracles to supervise optimal data augmentation in the deep feature space.

Cross-Domain Object Detection with Transformers

	
We explicitly estimate domain-invariant and domain-specific features in the image-token and object-token sequences for bi-directional alignment of the source and target domains. This is aimed at reducing the domain gap in domain-invariant representations, while simultaneously increasing the distinctiveness of domain-specific features.

Object Detection with Split Transformer

	
Self- and cross-attention in Transformers provide for high model capacity for object detection. We propose to split cross-attention into classification attention and box-regression attention, and also enable self-attention to account for pairs of adjacent object queries.

Incremental Few-shot Instance Segmentation

	
We address incremental few-shot instance segmentation, where a few examples of new object classes arrive after access to training examples of old classes is not available anymore, and the goal is to perform well on both old and new classes. A new classifier based on the probit function and an uncertainty-guided bounding-box predictor are specified.

Weakly Supervised Amodal Segmentation

	
We want to segment both visible (modal) and occluded (amodal) object parts, while training provides only ground-truth modal segmentations. A data manipulation is used to generate occlusions in training images, and predicted amodal segmentations of the manipulated training data are used as the pseudo-ground-truth amodal segmentation masks for the standard training of Mask-RCNN. An uncertainty map is estimated for each prediction for regularizing learning such that lower segmentation loss is incurred on regions with high uncertainty.

FAPIS: A Few-shot Anchor-free Part-based Instance Segmenter

	
In few-shot instance segmentation, training and test images do not share the same object classes. We explicitly model latent object parts shared across training classes, which facilitates our few-shot learning on new classes in testing. A new network is specified for delineating and weighting latent parts by their importance for instance segmentation.

Action Shuffle for Unsupervised Action Segmentation

	
We specify a new self-supervised learning of a feature embedding that accounts for both frame- and action-level structure of videos. An RNN is trained to recognize shuffled and unshuffled action sequences. As supervision of actions is not available, we specify an HMM and infer a MAP action segmentation for our self-supervised learning.

Self-Supervised GAN for Unsupervised Few-shot Object Recognition

	
We are given one large dataset of unlabeled images, and another smaller dataset in which we conduct image retrieval for given queries. The two datasets do not share object classes. We specify a new self-supervised learning for a GAN that reconstructs the randomly sampled latent codes of ``fake'' images.

Set-Supervised Action Segmentation

	
Training videos provide only the ground-truth set of actions present, but not their temporal ordering. In training, we estimate a set-constrained Viterbi loss from a MAP inference of an HMM which accounts for co-occurrences and temporal lengths of actions.

Riemannian Optimization on the Stiefel Manifold

	
Enforcing orthonormality on parameter matrices (e.g., of a deep neural network) amounts to Riemannian optimization on the Stiefel manifold. To this end, we specify a new retraction map based on the Cayley transform, and implicit vector transport based on a projection of the momentum and the Cayley transform on the Stiefel manifold.

Combining Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Smoothness Cues for Weakly Supervised Segmentation

	
We fuse three processes toward semantic segmentation -- namely, (i) Bottom-up computation of neural activations in a CNN for the image-level class prediction; (ii) Top-down estimation of attention maps of the CNN's activations given the predicted objects; and (iii) Lateral attention-message passing among neighboring neurons at the same CNN layer.

Affordance Segmentation in Images

	
Pixels of indoor scenes are labeled with five affordance types: walkable, sittable, lyable, reachable, and movable using a cascade of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs first extract mid-level visual cues, including: depth map, surface normals, and coarse semantic scene segmentation, and then combine them toward affordance segmentation.

Semantic Segmentation of RGBD Images with Mutex Constraints

	
Pixels are assigned class labels, such that the labeling strictly satisfies all mutual exclusion (mutex) constraints, and thus does not violate common-sense physics laws. The mutex constraints considered include: object co-occurrence, relative height and support relationships.

Tree-Cut for Probabilistic Image Segmentation

	
Given an image and its region tree, image segmentation is formalized as sampling cuts in the tree using dynamic programming. Our tree-cut model can be tuned to sample segmentations at a particular scale of interest, and thus conduct a scale-specific evaluation.

Person Count Localization in Videos

	
Given a video, we output for each frame a set of: 1) Detections optimally covering both isolated individuals and cluttered groups of people; and 2) Counts of people inside these detections. This problem is a middle-ground between frame-level person counting, which does not localize counts, and person detection aimed at perfectly localizing people with count-one detections.

Monocular Extraction of 2.1D Sketch Using Constrained Convex Optimization

	
We partition the image into regions, and estimate their depth ordering in the scene. This is cast as a constrained convex optimization problem, and solved within the optimization transfer framework. Our new optimization transfer admits a closed-form expression of the duality gap, and thus allows explicit computation of the achieved accuracy.

Multi-Object Tracking via Constrained Sequential Labeling

	
Constrained sequential labeling (CSL) assigns object identifiers to supervoxels, while respecting domain constraints. CSL is well-suited for simultaneous labeling and fixing noisy merges and splits of our mid-level features, which cannot be handled in a principled manner by traditional network flow approaches. CSL is efficient due to contraint propagation.

Inferring Dark Matter and Dark Energy from Videos

	
Functional objects do not have discriminative appearance and shape, but can be viewed as "dark matter", emanating "dark energy" that affects people’s trajectories in the video. For localizing functional objects, we analyze noisy behavior of people in the scene using agent-based, probabilistic Lagrangian mechanics.

Latent Multitask Learning for View-Invariant Action Recognition

	
When each viewpoint of a given set of action classes is specified as a learning task then multitask learning appears suitable for achieving view invariance in recognition. We extend the standard multitask learning to allow identifying: (1) latent groupings of action views (i.e., tasks), and (2) discriminative action parts, along with joint learning of all tasks.

Monte Carlo Tree Search for Scheduling Activity Recognition

SLEDGE: Sequential Labeling of Image Edges for Boundary Detection

	
We sequentially label image edges as "on" or "off" object boundaries. A visited edge is labeled as boundary based on evidence of its perceptual grouping with already identified boundaries. We use both local Gestalt cues, and the global Helmholtz principle of non-accidental grouping. Image edges are extracted with our new detector that finds salient pixel sequences which separate distinct textures within the image.

Hough Forest Random Field for Object Recognition and Segmentation

	
We combine Hough forest (HF) and conditional random field (CRF) into HFRF to assign labels of object classes to image regions. HF captures intrinsic and contextual properties of objects as class histograms in the leaf nodes. This evidence is used in CRF inference for non-parametric density estimation of the posteriors. Theoretical error bounds of HF and HFRF applied to a two-class object detection and segmentation are also presented.

Cost-Sensitive Top-down/Bottom-up Inference for Multiscale Activity Recognition

	
While prior work typically addresses activity recognition at a single scale, we jointly model group activities, individual actions, and participating objects with an AND-OR graph, and exploit its hierarchical structure for efficient inference. An explore-exploit strategy is used to adaptively zoom-in or zoom-out for cost-sensitive inference.

Activities with stochastic structure are characterized by variable space-time arrangements of subactivities, and may be conducted by a variable number of actors.

We estimate the 3D shape of a scene from texture arising from a spatial repetition of objects in the image.

Probabilistic Event Logic for Interval-Based Event Recognition

	
We introduce probabilistic event logic (PEL) for representing both hard and soft temporal constraints among events. A PEL knowledge base consists of confidence-weighted formulas from a temporal event logic, and specifies a joint distribution over the occurrence time intervals of all events. Our MAP inference for PEL addresses the scalability issue of reasoning about all time intervals in video, by leveraging the spanning-interval data structure. A spanning interval compactly represents entire sets of time intervals without enumerating them.

Activities as Time Series of Human Postures
	
We show that certain human actions can be represented by short time series of codewords.
