Sivaraman Balakrishnan

I am an Associate Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics and Data Science and in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon.

My research interests are broadly in statistical machine learning and algorithmic statistics. My interests span statistics, optimization, machine learning and information theory.

Most recently, I have been excited about topics in:

Robust Statistics and Domain Adaptation
Minimax Hypothesis Testing
Assumption-Light Inference
Causal Inference
Statistical Optimal Transport
Non-Parametric Statistics
Ranking, Crowdsourcing and Learning from Comparison Data
Convex and Non-Convex Optimization
Clustering and Topological Data Analysis

A more complete list of publications can be found here.

Before (re)-joining CMU, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley, under the able guidance of Martin Wainwright and Bin Yu. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon in the Language Technologies Institute working with Jaime Carbonell.

I am an Associate Editor for JASA.

My research has been generously supported by an Amazon Research Award (2021), a Google Research Scholar Award (2021), and by the NSF (CCF-1763734, DMS-1713003, DMS-2113684 and DMS-2310632).

I frequent the Statistics and Machine Learning Reading Group and the Causal Inference Working Group.
