Prospective Students
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis. I also hold a guest professor position in the Department of Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Novi Sad. Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Theory of Computation group, CSAIL, at MIT and I was fortunate to have Ronitt Rubinfeld as my host.

I received my PhD degree from the Computer Science department at EPFL, advised by Aleksander Mądry. After finishing my PhD and prior to coming to MIT, I spent two months at ETH hosted by Mohsen Ghaffari.

My research has been generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) and Google Research Scholar Program.

Research interests: Broadly speaking, I am interested in algorithmic graph theory and combinatorial approach to optimization. My research focuses on designing efficient algorithms in the context of memory-constrained computation, such as parallel, distributed, streaming and local computation.
Prospective students: If you are interested in my research and in working with me, please contact me. Please note that for a student to get admitted, it is necessary to submit the application through the official portal. Please check the instruction page for the deadline.
