I am interested in solving real-life data science problems through development of novel machine learning algorithms. I am also interested in building software that has intelligent behavior and can enhance human capabilities. My research is driven by open data science problems in a wide array of disciplines such as Public Health, Biomedicine, Physical Sciences, Education, Marketing, Social Sciences, Traffic Engineering, and Industrial Engineering.
