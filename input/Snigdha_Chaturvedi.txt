I am an Associate Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill. Before this, I was an Assistant Professor at UC-Santa Cruz and a postdoctoral researcher in Dan Roth's  group at the University of Pennsylvania and University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I finished my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park working with Dr. Hal Daume III. 

Before joining UMD, I was a Blue Scholar in the Information Management team at IBM-India Research Labs, New Delhi from Aug. 2009 to Aug. 2011. My undergraduate years were spent in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur from where I graduated in 2009 as a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering. 




My lab focuses on Nature Language Processing with a focus on narrative-like and socially aware understanding, summarization, and generation of language. You can find more details about and recent publications on my research page.

Note for prospective graduate students: Please check out my research and advisees pages to know more about our work or chat with my awesome students. Depending on the pool of applicants and my funding situation, I intend to take a student or so every year. If you are interested in working with me, please apply to our graduate program and list me as a faculty of interest. 

Note for undergraduate students: If you are writing to me about working with me, introduce yourself (which year are you in) and your background (what you know about ML/NLP though this is not a pre-requisite), and include your resume and transcript. Also, I don't have summer internship positions in my lab. 

If you are a graduate or undergraduate student and you are writing to me with a question that was not answered here,  include "CMPS" in your subject so that it doesn't go to my spam folder and I know that you have read this :)
