Description: Sofya Raskhodnikova
Professor of Computer Science, College of Arts and Sciences, Boston University
	My research interests include sublinear-time algorithms (in particular, property testing), private data analysis, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, and complexity theory. I am a member of the Algorithms and Theory group. Before joining BU, I was a professor in the CSE department at Penn State from 2007 to 2017. I got my PhD from MIT in 2003. From the fall of 2003 to 2006, I worked at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics. In 2013--2014, I was on sabbatical leave at Boston University for a special Privacy Year and also participated in the Privacy Tools project at Harvard University in Spring 2014. I participated in Foundations of Data Science in Fall 2018 and Data Privacy: Foundations and Applications in Spring 2019 at Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at Berkeley.

If you are interested in joining our CS graduate program, please look at http://www.bu.edu/cs/phd-program/ for information on admissions and a description of the program. Research assistantships are available for strong candidates interested in working in algorithms and theory. Our department receives many applications, and I cannot review all of them personally.

How To Pronounce My Name
Sofya: There are two syllables.
The first one sounds like Soft without the last sound.
The second, ya, sounds like German "yes".
The stress is on the first syllable. Sophia is not a correct pronounciation of my name. (There are both versions in Russian, Sofya and Sophia, but my name is not Sophia.)
Raskhodnikova: The only tricky part is that the first "k" is silent.
Ras
hod (stressed, the first sound as in "hat")
ni
ka (unstressed o is pronounced as a in Russian)
va
