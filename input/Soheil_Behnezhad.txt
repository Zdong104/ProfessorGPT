Description: Soheil Behnezhad
I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Northeastern University.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. Much of my work focuses on the theoretical foundations of big data algorithms. This includes sublinear algorithms, parallel algorithms, streaming algorithms, dynamic algorithms, and graph sparsification.

Before joining Northeastern, I had a wonderful year at Stanford as a Motwani postdoc hosted by Moses Charikar, Aviad Rubinstein, Amin Saberi, and Li-Yang Tan. I got my PhD from UMD where I was advised by MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi and my BSc from Sharif University.
