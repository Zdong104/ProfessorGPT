Associate Professor, CS @ UMD

Short Bio: Soheil Feizi is a faculty and the director of Reliable AI Lab in the Computer Science department at University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). Before joining UMD, he was a post-doctoral researcher at Stanford University . He received his Ph.D. in EECS, with a minor degree in Mathematics, at MIT. He has published over 100 peer-reviewed papers and given more than 50 invited talks. He has received multiple awards for his work including the ONR's Young Investigator Award, the NSF CAREER Award, the ARO's Early Career Program Award, two best paper awards, the Ernst Guillemin Thesis Award, a Teaching Award, and more than fifteen research awards from national agencies such as NSF, DARPA, ARL, ONR, DOE, NIST as well as industry such as Meta, IBM, Amazon, Qualcomm and Capital One. He is committed to promoting diversity in STEM and has mentored several high school, undergraduate, and graduate students through various programs. He is the organizer of the UMD's Rising Stars in Machine Learning program.




Research

My research is centered around developing reliable and trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a focus on understanding its robustness (to natural and/or adversarial noise), generalizability (to unforeseen data domains) and interpretability (of both test and training time predictions). I am interested in the reliability anslysis of both predictive and generative AI models.
