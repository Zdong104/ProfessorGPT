Background

I graduated with a Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science at the Carnegie Mellon University. Currently I am the Lubar professor in the Computer Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
My resume can be found here [PDF]

Research

My main areas of interests are at the intersection of security and formal methods (FM). Currently my active interests are in adversarial machine learning (AML) and privacy.

I have a peripheral interest in several topics (e.g. computational finance), but I have not been actively involved in the area for a several years.

Note: I have not been updating by publications page for a few years. My DBLP page is here and my Google scholar page is here. If you need to get a copy of one of my papers or have questions about them, feel free to contact me.
