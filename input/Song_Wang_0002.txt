About me

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 2002. Since then, I joined the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina, where I am currently working as a professor. My research is focused on computer vision, image processing, and machine learning, as well as their applications to video understanding, materials science, autonomous driving, medical imaging, underwater imaging, document analysis, and cultural heritage protection.
