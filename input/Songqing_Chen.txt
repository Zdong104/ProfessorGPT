Some Open Source Code
ffmpeg360: It is a tool for rendering 360-degree videos and converting between projection types. Operations are performed on the GPU within a fork of the FFmpeg utility. Its GitHub repository is here. Please refer to our paper for more details.

CAD (Content Assited Displaying for Mobile Device Power Saving): CAD for the online video calls is based on WebRTC. The implementation utilizes the GPU on mobile devices. Its GitHub repository is here. For more technical detail, please refer to our paper.

UMON (User Defined Monitoring for SDN based networks): UMON implements a separate monitoring table that decouples monitoring from switching in the open vSwitches. Its GitHub repository is here. For more technical detail, please refer to our paper.

XEN Scheduler: Cloud is subject to various side channel attacks due to underlying sharing of the physical resources. Our new schedulers can effectively mitigate such threats. Its GitHub repository is here. For more technical detail, please refer to our paper.

rKube: Containers are widely used in clouds, but they often fail to deliver the anticipated performance with the allocated resources. Our new mechanism, rKube, can effectively address that on top of Kubernetes and Linux. Its GitHub repository is here. For more technical detail, please refer to our paper.
