Bio

I am an Associate Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. I direct the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) lab, where we work on developing robots that are able to effectively operate in human environments. My research interests span robotics and artificial intelligence, including semantic reasoning, adaptive autonomy, human-robot interaction and explainable AI. Please visit the RAIL lab website for a description of our latest projects.

I also serve as the lead for the NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING), whose mission is to develop the next generation of personalized collaborative AI systems that improve the quality of life and independence of aging adults living at home.

I am General Co-Chair for CoRL 2023, together with Byron Boots! Come join us in Atlanta!!
