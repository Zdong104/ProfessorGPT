Description: Sonia Fahmy

	I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I am also a member of CERIAS (the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security). My research interests lie in the areas of network architectures and network protocols, specifically in designing network protocols to increase performance and security.

Research
Current and recent research projects include:
(1) Network support for virtual reality applications: We are designing networking and systems techniques to support distributed virtual reality applications (NSF project; Meta project);
(2) Network measurement and management: We are inferring and learning information about network traffic, topology, bottlenecks, bandwidth, latency, and loss, and exploiting this information for adapting and managing networks and applications (Juniper Networks project; GENI Project);
(3) Cellular networks: We are designing approaches to optimize cellular network control plane performance and security (Phase 1; Phase 2);
(4) Network experimentation: We are developing methodologies and benchmarks for network evaluation (DHS project and NSF project).

Our research projects are or have been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Homeland Security, AT&T, Cisco Systems, GENI Project, Hewlett-Packard, Juniper Networks, Meta, Northrop Grumman Corp, Sandia National Labs, Schlumberger, CERIAS, and the Purdue Research Foundation.
