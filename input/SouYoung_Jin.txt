I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College. Before joining Dartmouth, I was a postdoctoral associate at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working with Dr. Aude Oliva. Previously I earned my PhD in College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS), University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass Amherst), where I researched on improving face clustering in videos under Dr. Erik Learned-Miller in the Computer Vision Lab.

My main research area is in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Cognitive Science. My area of expertise is video understanding. As a computer vision researcher, one of my ultimate aspirations is to build an AI system that can understand and respond to the richness of human experience and emotion, much like Jarvis in the Iron Man movie. Here is my CV.

I will serve as an Area Chair at WACV 2025.

 I am looking for highly motivated students! If you want to join our lab, please apply to the Dartmouth CS PhD Program and mention SouYoung Jin on your application. The deadline is December 15, 2024. You do not need to email me.
If you are a Dartmouth student and would like to chat, feel free to schedule an appointment with me via this appointment page or please send your CV to my email address.

 Thank you for attending New England Computer Vision Workshop (NECV) 2023! See more stories at [Dartmouth News].
