My research focuses on the problems at the intersection of graphs, machine learning, and data science with a focus on bias, fairness, and interpretability. I also build machine learning based techniques that have high impact in the areas such as healthcare, infrastructure, and computational social science.

Before joining UIC, I was a research assistant professor in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO) hosted by Prof. Brian Uzzi. I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from University of California, Santa Barbara where I was advised by Prof. Ambuj Singh. I got my Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Automation Department from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India.
