SOUTI RINI CHATTOPADHYAY

Assistant Professor of Computer Science

Viterbi School of Engineering

University of Southern California

Hi! I'm Souti ['show-tēē], and I go by Rini. I am an Assistant Professor of CS at the Viterbi School of Engineering, USC. I work in HCI and Software Engineering, redesigning digital experiences to align software and human cognition based on psychological principles.
I am the founder of the Adaptive Computing Experiences (ACE) lab at USC. We investigate cognitive and social aspects of how humans interact with software across various activities from programming to building social identities.

Check out the ACE LAB website!

Outside of work, I am passionate about 🪴 plants of all kinds, 🎹making music 🎤, arts 🎨!
On a sunny day, you might catch me near the beautiful ☀️ 🌊 SoCal beaches or atop the mountains 🏔

Language, without bounds.
