Description: Srijan Das

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. At UNC Charlotte, I am working on Video Representation Learning, and Robotic Vision. I am a member of the Charlotte Machine Learning Lab (CharMLab) at UNC Charlotte.

Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at Stony Brook University under the supervision of Michael S. Ryoo. In 2020, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at INRIA, Sophia Antipolis, France under the supervision of Francois Bremond and Monique Thonnat. My Ph.D. thesis is on ¨Spatio-temporal attention mechanisms for Action Recognition¨ and click here to watch my Defense Presentation. I did my Post-Grad in Computer Science from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela.

Research

My research focuses on video representation learning, utilizing spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, multiple modalities, and both ego-exo centric viewpoints. I am also interested in vision-language models and self-supervised learning techniques. The primary applications of my research include action classification in trimmed videos, temporal action detection in untrimmed videos, video retrieval, robotic vision, and the development of video conversational agents.
