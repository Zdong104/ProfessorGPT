About Publications Group Teaching
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Brown University where I lead the Interactive 3D Vision & Learning Lab (IVL). My research is in 3D computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in 3D spatiotemporal visual understanding of human physical interactions with the world. I build methods for human-centric, object-centric, and interaction-centric understanding of our world from videos and images. I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER award (2022) and the Google Research Scholar award (2021).

Prospective Students/Postdocs: We are always looking for motivated students/postdocs to join us. Please see this page for details.




Outside of Brown, I spend part of my time as a Visiting Academic at Amazon Robotics. I was previously a postdoc at Stanford University with Leonidas Guibas. I obtained my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics advised by Christian Theobalt and Antti Oulasvirta. I have also spent time at Microsoft Research Redmond, the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, the Honda Research Institute, and College of Engineering Guindy.
