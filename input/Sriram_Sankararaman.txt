About me

I am a Professor of Computer Science, Human Genetics, and Computational Medicine at UCLA. I am broadly interested in problems at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and biomedicine. Here are recent videos that summarize work from our lab:

Scaling statistical models to millions of genomes@IMSI

Archaic admixture in human history@Radcliffe Institute

Signals of Ghost Archaic DNA in Present-Day West African Populations

Recovering signals of ghost archaic introgression in African populations@CARTA
