I am an Associate Professor and the Associate Head and Graduate Program Director of the Department of Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

I received my PhD in computer science from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2009, where I was a member of the Distributed Systems Lab. My PhD advisor was Professor Amr El Abbadi. From 2009 and 2011, I was a postdoc with Professor Bassam Bamieh at the Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation at UCSB, and from 2011 to 2013, I was a postdoc with Professor Idit Keidar in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Technion. My research interests are in federated learning, edge and cloud computing, and networked control systems.
