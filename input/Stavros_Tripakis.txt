Biography

Stavros Tripakis is an associate professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. Prior to joining Northeastern in 2018, he received his PhD in computer science by conducting research in the Verimag Laboratory at Joseph Fourier University located in Grenoble, France. Tripakis has held positions at the University of California – Berkeley, the French National Research Center (CNRS), Cadence Design Systems, and Aalto University.

Tripakis is interested in the foundations of software and system design. His research focuses on formal methods, computer-aided verification and synthesis, safety-critical, embedded and cyber-physical systems, and security. He is one of the faculty advisors for the Formal Methods Group, which develops theories and builds tools for designing better systems.

Tripakis was co-chair of the 10th ACM & IEEE Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT 2010). He also served on the board of ACM SIGBED as secretary/treasurer from 2009-2011, and as vice-chair from 2011-2013. His H-index, a metric that measures the productivity and citation impact of a scholar’s publications, is 50.
