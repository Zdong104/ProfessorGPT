About

I'm an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Oregon State University. My research focus is the development of agents that can perceive their environment and communicate about this understanding with humans in order to coordinate their actions to achieve mutual goals -- in short, agents that can see, talk, and act. Consequently, I work on problems in computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning in general.
