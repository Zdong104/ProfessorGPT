I am a tenured Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I direct the Interactive and Collaborative Autonomous Robotic Systems (ICAROS) lab. I graduated with a PhD from the CMU Robotics Institute and with a MS from MIT.

The research of the ICAROS lab focuses on enabling robots and autonomous agents to interact robustly with users in unconstrained and dynamic environments. We draw upon insights from artificial intelligence, human-robot interaction, procedural content generation and quality diversity optimization to make fundamental advances in both developing interactive agents to assist users in complex, real-world tasks, as well as in generating complex, diverse and realistic scenarios that effectively test the developed systems to enhance their robustness.
