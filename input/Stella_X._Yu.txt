My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, human vision, and machine learning. Visual perception presents not just a fascinating computational problem, but more importantly an intelligent solution for large-scale data mining and pattern recognition applications.

Human vision is a universal sensing system like no other: It is a flexible light meter, an instant geometer, a versatile material comparator, and a holistic parser. What fascinates me most is that babies with normal vision eventually all learn to see out of an initial nebulous blur and from their wide range of different visual experiences; such rich integrated sensing and recognition is so well developed that seeing becomes believing and visual reality the reality.

My research has thus three themes.

1. Actionable Representation Learning from Natural Data
I attribute our fast effortless vision to actionable representation learning driven by natural data, where mid-level visual pieces can be reassembled and adapted for seeing the new.
Recent works: Concurrent Segmentation and Recognition, Unsupervised Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation, The Emergence of Objectness, SegSort, Scalable NCA, Instance-Group Discrimination, Instance Discrimination, Open Compound Domain Adaptation, Open Long-Tailed Recognition, Unsupervised Selective Labeling.

2. Efficient Structure-Aware Machine Learning Models
I view a computational model as dual to the data it takes in; since visual data are full of structures, models reflective of such structures can achieve maximum efficiency.
Recent works: Emergent Data-Driven Prototypicality, Co-Domain Symmetry, SurReal: Complex-Valued Learning, Recurrent Parameter Generator, Orthogonal CNN, Clipped Hyperbolic Classifiers and CO-SNE.

3. Application to Science, Medicine, and Engineering
I am interested in applying computer vision and machine learning to capture and exceed human expertise, enabling automatic data-driven discoveries in science, medicine, and engineering.
Recent works: Unsupervised Phenotyping of Retinal Fundus Images and Demographics Prediction from Meibography, High Fidelity MRI Reconstruction, BatVision, Regional Scale Building Information Modeling, Iterative Human and Automated Identification of Wildlife Images, Dental Restoration.
