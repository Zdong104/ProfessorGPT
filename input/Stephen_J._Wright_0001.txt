Optimization Online




Mackay, December 2008








 

 

				
Research Interests



Numerical optimization, especially problems involving continuous variables. I'm interested in the theory, algorithms, and implementations, and in applications of all types.

 






Positions


Chair, Department of Computer Sciences at UW-Madison.
George B. Dantzig Professor of Computer Sciences.
Sheldon B. Lubar Chair of Computer Sciences.
Amar and Balinder Sohi Professor of Computer Sciences.
Discovery Fellow in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at UW-Madison.
National Academy of Engineering, 2024.
Khachiyan Prize from INFORMS Optimization Society, 2020.
Past Chair of the Mathematical Optimization Society .
SIAM Fellow and former member of the Board of Trustees of SIAM (2005-2014).
Site Director of the Institute for Foundations of Data Science.




Current Research


Design and analysis of algorithms for continuous optimization.
Optimization in machine learning and other areas.




Some Past Research Projects


Optimization software: PCx (linear programming), OOQP (convex quadratic programming).
Compressed sensing software: GPSR, SpaRSA. Also GPU codes for signal and image processing, and TV denoising software, and the LPS code for regularized logistic regression.
