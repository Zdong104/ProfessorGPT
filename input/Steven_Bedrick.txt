Research interests
I study ways to apply natural language processing techniques to a variety of biomedical problems, including clinical information retrieval, secondary analysis of electronic medical record data, and automatic assessment of neuropsychological disorders. My current projects include an automated tool for analyzing medical articles for use in systematic reviews, a novel communication platform for individuals with primary progressive aphasia, and an ongoing study of the linguistic patterns of children with autism.
