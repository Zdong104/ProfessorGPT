overview

My research is at the intersection of programming languages and artificial intelligence. I am part of the Programming Research Laboratory at Northeastern University, and I guide the Northeastern Probabilistic Programming Laboratory (NeuPPL).

I like designing systems that make probabilistic modeling fast, accessible, and useful for solving every day reasoning tasks. My research focuses on:

The design, implementation, and applications of probabilistic programming languages. I am currently the lead developer for dice; see this blog post for more information.
Foundations of probabilistic inference and tractable probabilistic modeling. Check out this paper on exploiting symmetry and this paper on unifying probabilistic circuits with determinantal point processes. My group develops rsdd, a high-performance implementation of tractable probabilistic models in rust.
Automated reasoning and probabilistic verification; see this paper for our latest work on program logics for probabilistic program verification.
