Office: TCS Hall 424

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, with my primary appointment in the Software and Societal Systems Department (with the Societal Computing program), and affiliated appointments with the Machine Learning Department and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. I am also affiliated with the CyLab and the Theory Group.

My broad research interests are in algorithms and machine learning. These days I am excited about:

Foundations of responsible AI, with emphasis on privacy, bias, and uncertainty considerations.
Interactive learning, including contextual bandits and reinforcement learning, and its interactions with causal inference and econometrics.
Economic aspects of machine learning, with a focus on learning in multi-agent settings.
My research has been generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) (including an NSF CAREER Award), the Okawa Foundation, CMU’s Block Center for Technology and Society, an Amazon Research Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, J.P. Morgan Faculty Awards, Meta Research awards, a Mozilla Research Grant, Apple, and Cisco Research.
