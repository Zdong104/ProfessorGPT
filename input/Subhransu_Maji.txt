About me

I am an Associate Professor in the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and the co-director of the Computer Vision Lab. I am also affilated with the Center of Data Science. Prior to this I was a Research Assistant Professor at TTI Chicago. I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Jitendra Malik from the University of California at Berkeley in 2011, and a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 2006. In the past I have enjoyed working at the University of Amsterdam, AWS AI, Google, INRIA, Microsoft Research, the CLSP center at JHU, and Oxford University. My research is funded by the National Science Foundation, including a CAREER award, NASA, as well as awards from Climate Change AI, Facebook, NVIDIA, Dolby, and Adobe.

My research focusses on high-level visual recognition algorithms. I am also intereted in AI applications for science, particularly in Ecology and Remote Sensing. For an overview of my research take a look at my recent publications, CV and research statement (visualized as a word cloud). I am also on Google scholar.
