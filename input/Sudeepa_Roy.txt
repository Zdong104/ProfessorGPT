News
I am serving as the PC Chair of the 28th International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT) 2025, to be held in Barcelona, Spain in March 2025 as the EDBT/ICDT 2025 Joint Conference. The submission deadlines for two cycles are March 18, 2024 and September 19, 2024. The call for paper can be found here. There are two tracks on regular research papers (15 pages) and short papers on DB Theory + X (4 pages) showcasing applications of database theory. If you worked on principles of data management or related fields, or applications of DB theory, please consider submitting a paper!


In 2023-24, I am spending a wonderful sabbatical in Berkeley, CA.

I spent Fall'23 at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, University of California, Berkeley, where I co-organized (with Guy Van den Broeck, Hung Ngo, Dan Suciu, and Virginia Vassilevska Williams) a semester-long program titled Logic and Algorithms in Database Theory and AI. This program was attended by about 100 long-term and short-term participants. Please check out the webpage for the videos and slides of many tutorials and talks!

I am spending Spring'24 as a Visiting Scientist at RelationalAI, and also as a Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley Sky Computing, hosted by Prof. Joe Hellerstein.


I am honored to give an invited keynote at the EDBT/ICDT Joint Conference 2024 in Paestum, Italy on March 25, 2024 titled "How Database Theory Helps Teach Relational Queries in Database Education".


Two papers at SIGMOD 2024 and one paper at PODS 2024, Santiago, Chile: "Summarized Causal Explanations For Aggregate Views" (with Brit Youngmann, Amir Gilad, and Michael Cafarella) and "Qr-Hint: Actionable Hints for Guided SQL Query Debugging" (with Yihao Hu, Amir Gilad, Kristin Stephens-Martinez, and Jun Yang) in SIGMOD, and "Evaluating Datalog over Semirings: A Grounding-based Approach" (with Hangdong Zhao, Shaleen Deep, Paris Koutris, and Val Tannen) in PODS.

Background

I joined the Department of Computer Science at Duke University in Fall 2015.
I am a member of the Duke Database Group (a.k.a. Duke Database Devils; more about Duke Blue Devils),
which is part of the Duke Systems Group.

Before joining Duke, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
University of Washington where I worked with Prof. Dan Suciu and the database group.

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science where I was advised by
Prof. Susan Davidson and Prof. Sanjeev Khanna. During my Ph.D., I did two internships at IBM Research, Almaden.




Research
I am broadly interested in data and information management with a focus on foundational aspects of databases and
big data analysis. My current research focuses on building tools and techniques to help users leverage the maximum benefit
from the available data. While my ongoing work on causality and explanations in databases directly aims to assist users get
deep insights into data by providing causal analysis and rich explanations to their questions, they often motivate the questions we studied in our recent work data repair and query optimization. My earlier work in the areas of data and workflow provenance,
probabilistic databases, and crowd-sourcing probed into compelling, fundamental questions that need to be answered
to enable end-to-end processing and analysis of unstructured, noisy, and unreliable data in today's world while preserving its entire context.

See my publications.
