I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Techology. Previously, I was an NSF/CRA Computing Innovation Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Pennsylvania, mentored by Rajeev Alur. I completed Ph.D at Rice University, advised by Moshe Y. Vardi.

I lead the BansalLab at Georgia Tech. We are growing. Look here for open positions.

I am broadly interested in Formal Methods and Logic, and their applications to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Programming Languages. The long-term research goal is to build Trustworthy AI by simplifying the design-development-deployment pipeline of safe and reliable AI systems. My current research thrusts include:

Formal Methods for Reinforcement Learning [ICML24, AAAI23Tutorial, SAS22Keynote, CAV22, NeurIPS21, Henzinger60]
Reactive Synthesis from High-Level Specifications [FMCAD 2024, ATVA23 (Best Paper), CAV21, POPL20, AAAI20, CAV18a]
Symbolic Quantitative Reasoning [IJCAI23, AAAI22, TACAS21, CAV19, CAV18b, FoSSaCS18]
