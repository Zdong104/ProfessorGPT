Suman Banerjee received his PhD in Computer Science from University of Maryland in 2003 and joined the faculty of University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is the winner of the ACM SIGMOBILE Rockstar Award in 2013 (awarded for early career achievements in the field of mobile computing and wireless networking). He is currently serving as the chair of ACM SIGMOBILE (since July 2013). He received an NSF Career Award in 2008.
Research
I lead the WIsconsin WIreless and NetworkinG Systems (WiNGS) Laboratory. Research in the WiNGS lab is conducted in the areas of networking and distributed systems with a primary focus on wireless and mobile networking. Also feel free to browse some of our recent publications for additional information.
A significant focus of my current research is in mobile computing and wireless networking.

Select recent research projects (More detailed research snapshot --- October 2011):

Airshark: Detecting non-WiFi interferers (Bluetooth, Microwave ovens, Game Controllers, ZigBee, Analog phones, etc.) by only using commodity WiFi Cards. [IMC 2011], [YouTube video]
Media coverage: Network World, Slashdot, CRA Highlight of the week, PC Magazine, The Register, BoingBoing

PIE: mapping WiFi-WiFi interference in enterprise WLANs in real-time. [NSDI 2011], [YouTube video]

WiScape: monitoring performance of wide-area cellular networks using client assistance (data collected for more than 2 years covering more than 60 sq. miles in and around Madison, and also across various parts of the US midwest). [IMC 2011], [Datasets coming soon]

WiRover: providing high bandwidth Internet connectivity to moving vehicles (public buses, ambulances, etc.) by exploiting network diversity and aggregation.
Media coverage: Wisconsin State Journal, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel WTN News
This work is also the grand prize winner of the Wisconsin Governor's Business Plan Competition 2011.

Interested in trialing WiRover for your application? (Madison Metro Transit and Van Galder, two local bus operators are doing this currently.) Contact Prof. Suman Banerjee.

Apex: provides an improved media streaming experience over wireless channels by making the PHY layer "value-aware," i.e., by making the PHY layer understand the relative value of different bits to the application. [Sigcomm 2010]

Some prior projects: CENTAUR | Modeling partial overlap | NICE overlay multicast

Description of my research work (April 2004)

Tools/Software: NetDyn | SONIC simulator | myns (P2P) simulator | NICE appl. layer multicast + PRM enhancements (freeBSD)
