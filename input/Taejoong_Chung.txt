TAEJOONG (TIJAY) CHUNG
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR
VIRGINIA TECH

My research primarily centers on understanding and enhancing Internet security protocols for DNS, the Web, Routing, and Emails.

UPDATES
Jul 18 2024 NTIA published comments regarding the Reporting on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Risk Mitigation Progress Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). RoVista is used to measure the Route Origin Validation (ROV) status in the United States.
May 16 2024 FCC recently proposed Internet Routing Security Reporting Requirements. In the accompanying fact sheet, RoVista is mentioned as an example approach for understanding ROV!
Apr 13 2024 I am honored to be awarded the NSF CAREER Award; this proposal aims to enhance security protocols for Internet Routing and Naming.
Apr 02 2024 I am honored to be awarded the Outstanding New Assistant Professor at the College of Engineering, Virginia Tech.
Apr 02 2024 My Ph.D. student, Weitong, will be working at CableLabs for his summer internship to work on RPKI.
Mar 25 2024 I have multiple funded openings for Ph.D and Masters students. Please take a look at this and feel free to email me.
Mar 25 2024 My Ph.D. student, Ishtiaq will be working at Meta for his summer internship to work on TLS and browser.
Feb 13 2024 I gave a talk at NANOG 90 to present our RPKI study and RoVista
Nov 21 2023 I am truly honored to be selected for the 2024 DNS-OARC Programme Committee.
Nov 09 2023 RoVista is currently used by Internet Society Pulse for showing global RoV deployment.
