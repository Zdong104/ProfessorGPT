CV

I am an Associate Professor of Linguistics and Data Science at New York University, and a Research Scientist at Google. At NYU, I direct the Computation and Psycholinguistics Lab; we use behavioral experiments and computational methods to study how people learn and understand language. We also develop methods for evaluating, understanding and improving computational systems for language processing.

I am accepting PhD students for Fall 2025 through either Linguistics or Data Science; I look forward to reading your applications! Please read the FAQ before contacting me about PhD admissions.
