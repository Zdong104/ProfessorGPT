MISSION
Exploration of the computer science frontier at the intersection of logical, physical, and social realms.
RESEARCH

CYBER-PHYSICAL COMPUTING

A versatile collection of research directions are investigated in this group, ranging from social sensing to the Internet of Things and from signal processing to edge AI, with applications from autonomous cars to future defense systems. These avenues of investigation share one fundamental goal: empower computing systems that are better integrated with the physical and social environment. Such integration has reprecussions on time, space, energy, and performance dimensions. New theory, design tools, development paradigms, and run-time services are needed to understand, optimize, and deploy these systems, leading to a broad set of research challenges, a rich source of inspiration, and great opportunities for societal impact.

RESEARCH THEMES
