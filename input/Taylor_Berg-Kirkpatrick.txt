I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. My research group works on natural language processing and machine learning, focusing on unsupervised methods for deciphering hidden structure. We develop techniques for analyzing various kinds of human data, including natural language -- but also diverse sources like early modern books, handwritten text, historical ciphers, and music.
