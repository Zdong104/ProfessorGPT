Getting it Right: Improving Spatial Consistency in Text-to-Image Models

Agneet Chatterjee, Gabriela Ben Melech Stan, Estelle Aflalo, Sayak Paul, Dhruba Ghosh, Tejas Gokhale, Ludwig Schmidt, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Vasudev Lal, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
pdf web code demo

We improve spatial understanding of T2I models by creating the SPRIGHT dataset by recaptioning 6M images from widely used vision datasets. Finetuning T2I models with just 500 images from SPRIGHT leads to a large improvement in T2I spatial understanding performance, across several evaluation benchmarks such as T2I-CompBench, VISOR, and GenEval.

REVISION: Rendering Tools Enable Spatial Fidelity in Vision-Language Models
ECCV 2024
Agneet Chatterjee, Tejas Gokhale, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
pdf

Traditional generative Text-to-Image models struggle to generate images that faithfully represent the spatial relationships mentioned in the input prompt. We develop REVISION, an efficient rendering pipeline that enables a training-free, guidance-based mechanism to address this shortcoming. REVISION takes the objects and their spatial relationships parsed from the given input prompt and synthesizes an image in Blender, placing the respective object assets at coordinates corresponding to the parsed spatial relationship. Given a user-provided input prompt T, we synthesize an image using REVISION and use it to guide existing T2I pipelines such as Stable Diffusion or ControlNet to obtain a spatially accurate output.

Improving Shift Invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks with Translation Invariant Polyphase Sampling
preprint
Sourajit Saha, Tejas Gokhale
pdf code

We identify that the tendency of existing pooling layers in CNNs to pass larger signals to subsequent layers is a major factor that's strongly correlated with the lack of shift invariance in CNNs. Based on this finding, we design a new pooling operator Translation-Invariant Polyphase Sampling (TIPS) and two regularizations on the intermediate feature maps to learn translation-invariant representations. TIPS results in consistent and architecture-agnostic improvements in accuracy and four measures of shift invariance, across multiple image classification and segmentation benchmarks.

On the Robustness of Language Guidance for Low-Level Vision Tasks: Findings from Depth Estimation
CVPR 2024
Agneet Chatterjee, Yiran Luo, Tejas Gokhale, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
pdf web code

The motivation of this work is to analyze the efficacy of language guidance for low-level non-semantic computer vision tasks. We focus on depth estimation and find that language-guided depth estimators benefit only from scene-level language information and counter-intuitively, are worse off when presented with sentences that describe 3D spatial relationships in the scene. With an increasing number of methods using language for depth estimation, our findings highlight the opportunities and pitfalls that require careful consideration for effective deployment in real-world settings.

Grounding Stylistic Domain Generalization with Quantitative Domain Shift Measures and Synthetic Scene Images
CVPR 2024 Workshop on Vision Dataset Understanding
Yiran Luo, Joshua Feinglass, Tejas Gokhale, Kuan-Cheng Lee, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
pdf data [Best Paper Award]

Two new quantitative measures ICV and IDD to describe domain shifts in terms of consistency of classes within one domain and similarity between two stylistic domains. New dataset: SuperMarioDomains (SMD) incorporating unique features of consistent classes of video game scenes across stylistic domains in video game graphics that are dissimilar to ImageNet1K.

ConceptBed: Evaluating Concept Learning Abilities of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
AAAI 2024 and Neurips 2023 Workshop on Diffusion Models
Maitreya Patel, Tejas Gokhale, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
pdf web code

Textual inversion models have the potential to learn novel concepts from a small number of example images. We quantify this concept learning ability with ConceptBed: a dataset that contains 284 unique visual concepts and 33K concept compositions, and CCD (Concept Confidence Deviation): an evaluation metric uses the confidence of oracle concept classifiers to measure the alignment between generated images and concepts contained in ground truth images.

Adversarial Bayesian Augmentation for Single-Source Domain Generalization
ICCV 2023
Sheng Cheng, Tejas Gokhale, Yezhou Yang
pdf code


ABA draws on the strengths of adversarial learning and Bayesian neural networks to guide the generation of diverse data augmentations â€” these synthesized image domains aid the classifier in generalizing to several types of domain shift including style shift, subpopulation shift, and domain shift in the medical imaging setting. ABA outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods, including pre-specified augmentations, pixel-based and convolutional-based augmentations.

This dissertation contributes to the reliability of machine learning models from several perspectives including the development of robust training algorithms to mitigate the risks of such failures, construction of new datasets that provide a new perspective on capabilities of vision models, and the design of evaluation metrics for re-calibrating the perception of performance improvements.

End-to-end Knowledge Retrieval with Multi-modal Queries
ACL 2023
Man Luo, Zhiyuan Fang, Tejas Gokhale, Yezhou Yang, Chitta Baral
pdf data


Knowledge retrieval with multi-modal queries, i.e., queries containing information split across image and text inputs, a challenging task that differs from previous work on cross-modal retrieval. A new dataset called ReMuQ, a new pretraining task for learning knowledge retrieval with multimodal queries, and a retriever model "ReViz" that can directly process input text and images to retrieve relevant knowledge in an end-to-end fashion without being dependent on intermediate modules such as object detectors or caption generators.

Mole Recruitment: Poisoning of Image Classifiers via Selective Batch Sampling
preprint
Ethan Wisdom, Tejas Gokhale, Yezhou Yang
pdf code


A data poisoning attack that confounds ML models without any manipulation of the image or label, achieved by simply leveraging the most confounding natural samples found within the training data itself. We show the efficacy of this novel attack in offline as well as continual learning (CL) settings in image classification, thereby exposing a previously undetected vulnerability of image classifiers.

Benchmarking Spatial Relationships in Text-to-Image Generation
preprint
Tejas Gokhale, Hamid Palangi, Besmira Nushi, Vibhav Vineet, Eric Horvitz, Ece Kamar, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
pdf web code [featured on MSR blog]

We report a surprising finding that, although recent state-of-the-art T2I models exhibit high image quality, they are severely limited in their ability to generate multiple objects or the specified spatial relations such as left/right/above/below. We introduce a metric called VISOR to quantify spatial reasoning performance. VISOR can be used off-the-shelf with any text-to-image model. We construct and make available SR2D, a dataset which contains sentences that describe spatial relationships (left/right/above/below) between a pair of commonly occurring objects.

ALT discovers diverse and adversarial transformations using an image-to-image neural network with learnable weights. ALT improves the state-of-the-art single domain generalization performance on three benchmarks and is significantly better than pixel-wise adversarial training and standard data augmentation techniques.

CRIPP-VQA: Counterfactual Reasoning about Implicit Physical Properties via Video Question Answering
EMNLP 2022
Maitreya Patel, Tejas Gokhale, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
pdf web code

Although the imaging pipeline is unable to capture many physical properties of objects (eg. mass and coefficient of friction), these properties can be estimated by utilizing cues introduced by collisions. We introduce a new dataset (CRIPP-VQA) for reasoning about the implicit physical properties of objects from videos. The dataset contains videos of objects in motion, annotated with hypothetical/counterfactual questions about the effect of actions (removing/adding/replacing objects) and questions about planning (performing actions to reach a goal).

Covariate Shift Detection via Domain Interpolation Sensitivity
NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on Interpolation and Beyond
Tejas Gokhale, Joshua Feinglass, Yezhou Yang
pdf video

In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for covariate shift detection (CSD), that builds upon and complements previous work on domain generalization. We find that existing novelty detection methods designed for OOD benchmarks perform worse than simple confidence-based methods on our CSD benchmark. We propose Domain Interpolation Sensitivity (DIS), based on the simple hypothesis that interpolation between the test input and randomly sampled inputs from the training domain, offers sufficient information to distinguish between the training domain and unseen domains under covariate shift.

Unsupervised Natural Language Inference Using PHL Triplet Generation
ACL Findings 2022
Neeraj Varshney, Pratyay Banerjee, Tejas Gokhale, Chitta Baral,

Natural Language Inference (NLI) under three low-data settings (with missing labels; with missing labels and hypothesis; and with missing labels, hypotheses, and premises). A procedural data generation approach that leverages a set of sentence transformations to collect PHL (Premise, Hypothesis, Label) triplets for training NLI models, bypassing the need for human-annotated training data. State-of-the-art results under all three "unsupervised" settings.

pdf video

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of common data modification strategies and evaluate not only their in-domain and OOD performance, but also their adversarial robustness (AR). This work serves as an empirical study towards understanding the relationship between generalizing to unseen domains and defending against adversarial perturbations.

To Find Waldo You Need Contextual Cues: Debiasing Who's Waldo
ACL 2022
Yiran Luo, Pratyay Banerjee, Tejas Gokhale, Yezhou Yang, Chitta Baral
pdf data

We present a debiased dataset for the Person Centric Visual Grounding (PCVG) task. For instance, in many cases the first name in the sentence corresponds to the largest bounding box, or the sequence of names in the sentence corresponds to an exact left-to-right order in the image). The debiased dataset offers the PCVG task a more practical baseline for reliable benchmarking and future improvements.

Improving Biomedical Information Retrieval with Neural Retrievers

MUTANT: A Training Paradigm for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Visual Question Answering
EMNLP 2020
Tejas Gokhale, Pratyay Banerjee, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
pdf data

MUTANT is a training paradigm that exposes VQA models to perceptually similar, yet semantically distinct mutations of the input image or question. We use a pairwise consistency loss between answers to original and mutant inputs as a regularization, along with an answer embedding NCE loss. MUTANTimproves generalization of VQA models under Changing Priors.

Video2Commonsense: Generating Commonsense Descriptions to Enrich Video Captioning
