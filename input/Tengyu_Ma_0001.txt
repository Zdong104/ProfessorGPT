About

Hi! I am an assistant professor of computer science and statistics at Stanford. My research interests broadly include topics in machine learning, algorithms and their theory, such as deep learning, (deep) reinforcement learning, pre-training / foundation models, robustness, non-convex optimization, distributed optimization, and high-dimensional statistics.
