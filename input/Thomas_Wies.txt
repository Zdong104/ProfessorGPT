I am a Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University and a member of the Analysis of Computer Systems Group. See my curriculum vitae for further details.

Research

My research focuses on program analysis and verification, automated deduction, concurrent software, and software productivity.

Tools

As a byproduct of my research, I have developed and contributed to a number of tools.

GRASShopper
A verification tool that checks functional correctness of programs manipulating heap-allocated data structures.
Vermeer
An automated debugging tool that traces and explains faults in C programs.
Picasso
A static analyzer for depth-bounded concurrent systems. It has been used to verify properties of non-blocking concurrent data structures and distributed message passing algorithms with an unbounded number of threads and messages.
