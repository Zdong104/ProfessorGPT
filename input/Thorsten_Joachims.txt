Bio

Thorsten Joachims is a Jacob Gould Schurman Professor in the Department of Computer Science and in the Department of Information Science at Cornell University. He is the Associate Dean for Research for Bowers CIS, and he has served as Chair of the Department of Information Science. He is the Director of the Cornell AI Radical Collaboration. He has served as Program Chair of the ICML and KDD conferences, and he is a member of the IMLS Board and the SIGKDD Executive Committee. Thorsten Joachims joined Cornell in 2001 after finishing his Ph. D. as a student of Prof. Morik at the AI-unit of the University of Dortmund, from where he also received a Diplom in Computer Science in 1997. Between 2000 and 2001 he worked as a PostDoc at the GMD in the Knowledge Discovery Team of the Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems. From 1994 to 1996 he spent one and a half years at Carnegie Mellon University as a visiting scholar of Prof. Tom Mitchell. Working with his students and collaborators, his papers won 11 Best Paper Awards and 4 Test-of-Time Awards. Thorsten Joachims is an ACM Fellow, AAAI Fellow, and member of the SIGIR Academy.
