👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and a proud member of the Cake Lab! Broadly, I am interested in designing systems mechanisms and policies to handle trade-offs in cost, performance, and efficiency for emerging applications. Specifically, I have worked on projects related to cloud/edge resource management, big data frameworks, deep learning inference, distributed training, neural architecture search, and AR/VR. My recent work has a strong focus on improving system support for deep learning and on the practical applications of deep learning in AR/VR.

I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts Amherst advised by Prof. Prashant Shenoy. Before that, I received my B.E. from Nanjing University and was an exchange student at National Cheng Kung University.

Measuring the Impact of Gradient Accumulation on Cloud-based Distributed Training

Zimeng Huang, Bo Jiang, Tian Guo, Yunzhuo Liu

THE 23rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium On Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid'23)

Paper

Though GA is a commonly adopted technique for addressing the GPU memory shortage problem in model training, its benefits to model training have not been systematically studied. This paper evaluates and summarizes the benefits of GA, especially in terms of cloud-based distributed training scenarios, where training cost is determined by both execution time and resource consumption.

LayerCake: Efficient Inference Serving with Cloud and Mobile Resources

Sam Ogden, Tian Guo

THE 23rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium On Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid'23)

Paper

The landscape of DL inference has changed drastically since our first paper on mobile deep inference! Many mobile-oriented models have arised and more apps are leveraging DL models. This paper considers the dynamic inference execution environment and schedules the request to the best-available resource.

Multi-Camera Lighting Estimation for Photorealistic Front-Facing Mobile Augmented Reality

Yiqin Zhao, Sean Fanello, Tian Guo

The Twenty-fourth International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (Hotmobile'23)

Paper

We demonstrate the promise of dual-camera lighting estimation in improving rendering effects for virtual try-on AR applications. Furthermore, we also show that an existing SToA lighting estimation model can't fully utilize the enlarged camera view.

FuncPipe: A Pipelined Serverless Framework for Fast and Cost-efficient Training of Deep Learning Models

Yunzhuo Liu, Bo Jiang, Tian Guo, Zimeng Huang, Wenhao Ma, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou

Proceedings of ACM SIGMETRICS, 2023 (SIGMETRICS'23)

Paper , Project

FuncPipe co-optimzes model partition and serverless resource allocation to reduce memory consumption and also relieve communication burden in distributed training. Further, we designed a pipelined scatter-reduce to simultaneously utilize downlink/uplink bandwidth.
