About me

I am an assistant professor at the University of Virginia. I got my PhD from Purdue University and my Bachelor’s degree from Fudan University. I work on differential privacy and machine learning privacy, focusing on designing algorithms that work in practice.

My lovely wife Xuejun Zhao is an assistant professor in Information System and Operations Management at UNC Charlotte.
