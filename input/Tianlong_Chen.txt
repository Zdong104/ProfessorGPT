Bio

Tianlong Chen received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Texas at Austin, TX, USA, in 2023. He starts as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in Fall 2024. Before that, he is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CSAIL@MIT), Harvard (BMI@Harvard), and Borad Institute of MIT & Harvard in 2023-2024.

His research focuses on building accurate, trustworthy, and efficient machine learning systems. He devotes his most recent passion to various (A) important machine learning problems - sparsity, robustness, learning to optimize, graph learning, and diffusion models; (B) interdisciplinary scientific challenges - bioengineering and quantum comptuing. He received IBM Ph.D. Fellowship, Adobe Ph.D. Fellowship, Graduate Dean's Prestigious Fellowship, AdvML Rising Star, and the Best Paper Award from the inaugural Learning on Graphs (LoG) Conference 2022.

I am looking for highly motivated students, in terms of RA/TA/externship/internship/visiting students. Interested candidates are strongly encouraged to contact me by email, together with resume and transcripts.
