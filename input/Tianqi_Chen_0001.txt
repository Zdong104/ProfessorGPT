I am an Assistant Professor in the Machine Learning Department and Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University . I help run the Catalyst Group. I am also the Chief Technologist of OctoML. I recently received my Ph.D. from Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington.

At UW, I was advised by Carlos Guestrin. I also worked closely with Luis Ceze and Arvind Krishnamurthy. I was a member of SAMPL Lab and MODE Lab. I recieved my Master and Bachelor's degree from Prof. Yong Yu's ACM Honors Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

Research

I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems. The real excitement of this area comes from what can enable when we bring advanced learning techniques and system together. On that end, I am also pushing the direction on deep learning, knowledge transfer and lifelong learning.


I am a believer of open source and open science. My group involves publishing algorithms in openly accessible mediums and building open-source machine learning systems that are widely adopted. Here are the ML systems that I created:

Apache TVM, an Automated End-to-End Optimizing Compiler for Deep Learning.

XGBoost, a scalable tree boosting system.

Apache MXNet(co-creator)
