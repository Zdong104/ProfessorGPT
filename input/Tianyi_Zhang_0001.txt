Biography

Tianyi Zhang is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Societal Impact Fellow at Purdue University. At Purdue, he leads the Human-Centered Software Systems Lab, where he and his students develop intelligent systems that synergize human expertise with machine intelligence, with a particular focus on improving programming productivity and the robustness and safety of modern software. Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University, working with Dr. Elena Glassman. He obtained his Ph.D. in CS from UCLA in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. Miryung Kim. His work has been recognized with an NSF Career Award, an Amazon Research Award, and Best Paper Honorable Mention Awards from SIGCHI and VAHC.

Research

My research is in the intersection of Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and AI. I am broadly interested in building interactive intelligent systems that (1) augment human intelligence with data-driven insights and (2) augment machine intelligence with human guidance. Most of my work is designed for people in the programming domain, including software developers, novice programmers, and computer end-users.

My work on code mining and visualization helps programmers make more informed decisions by unveiling what others have and have not done in similar contexts in GitHub and Stack Overflow (ICSE 2018, CHI 2018, ICSE 2019, CHI 2020, CHI 2021a, UIST 2022a).
My work on program synthesis helps novices and end-users better communicate their intent and guide a synthesizer with enriched feedback loops and interpretability (UIST 2020, CHI 2021b, UIST 2022b).
My work on autonomous driving testing enhances our understading of developer needs of testing autonomous driving systems and enables developers to express richer and more efficient test scenarios (ESEC/FSE 2022a, ESEC/FSE 2022b, TSE 2022).

I also work on research topics including code search (ICSE 2015, ICSE 2019, ESEC/FSE 2020 Industry), test reuse (ICSE 2017), software debloating (ESEC/FSE 2020), and empirical studies on deep learning engineering (ISSRE 2019, PerCom 2020). Beyond that, I have collaborated with psychiatrists at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital to help them explore massive amounts of health records and develop data-driven insights about disease progression and treatment trajectories (VAHC 2021).
