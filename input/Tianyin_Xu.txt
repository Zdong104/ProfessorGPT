This is Tianyin, a watchman in the cornfields who tries to do relevant systems research. More professionally, I am an ass prof in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I'm also affiliated with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UIUC.

Before joining UIUC, I spent a year at Facebook's Core Systems, working on dealing with datacenter failures and eating free food (see my interview by Facebook). I spent six wonderful years at sysnet at the University of California San Diego until my rock star advisor kicked me out (I wished to be a tenured grad student1). I worked with NetApp to study production data ontap. I had a short experience at Whova where I learned dedication. I worked in Germany and backpacked Europe for 1.5 years at Goettingen before starting my grad school.

As a "professor", my meta-advice is to be serious and sincere to life and work. Winter is coming! Don't fight a fake war or someone else's war. Fight for what matters to the living or the dead.

I am a part of CS CARES. If you need help, please don't hesitate to reach out -- you'll never walk alone.

1 I am constantly looking for such a job. Please contact me if you have or know one.


 
$ head research_interests
 	

The goal of my research is to make computer systems reliable and secure, especially those operating at the cloud and datacenter scale. My mission is to help today's systems defend against all kinds of errors and defects, such as software bugs, configuration errors, and design flaws. I am very happy that some of our work helps improve reliability of real-world systems (check out bugs we detected/fixed).

I am interested in all kinds of black magic. My view of systems research is to build the right swords to fight the dragon (not windmills).
