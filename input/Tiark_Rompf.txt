Kevin C. and Susanne L. Kahn New Frontiers Associate Professor at Purdue University

My scientific home is in programming languages and compilers, but my work spans architecture, databases, systems, machine learning, and AI.

I'm co-directing the Purdue Center for Programming Principles and Software Systems (PurPL). I am also a Scientific Advisor at SambaNova Systems.

Research

I'm actively recruiting PhD students and post-docs to work on the following projects:


Reachability Types: How can we bring the benefits of Rust-style tracking of lifetimes and sharing to higher-level languages?
Keywords: Scala, Coq, Mechanized Proofs, Logical Relations
Papers: POPL'24, OOPSLA'23, OOPSLA'21, ARXIV '23

Rhyme: How can we design expressive languages and efficient compiler toolchains for high-level data processing?
Keywords: Datalog, Graph IRs, E-Graphs, Incremental/Bidirectional Computation
Papers: PADL'24, POPL'24, SIGMOD'22, JFP'19, OSDI'18, SIGMOD'18

Purdue is ranked #3 in PL+SE on csrankings.org. Apply here.
