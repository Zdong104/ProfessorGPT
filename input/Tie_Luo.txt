Biosketch: I am an Associate Professor and Associate Chair for Academic Affairs in the Department of Computer Science at Missouri University of Science and Technology, where I am also a faculty investigator of four research centers: Intelligent Systems Center (ISC), Center for Intelligent Infrastructure (CII), High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC), and Center for Biology Research (CBR). Prior to joining Missouri S&T in December 2019, I was a Scientist and Program Lead at A*STAR, Singapore's foremost research institute. I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore (global university ranking: #8 by QS, #19 by Times Higher Education (THE), #22 (CS #3, EE #5) by U.S. News & World Report). My current research centers on Trustworthy AI and IoT, with specific focus on adversarial machine learning, explainable and robust AI for medicine and healthcare, secure and privacy-preserving federated learning, and time series analysis for IoT and edge computing. I have received five Best Paper awards or nominations. I am a member of AAAI and ACM, and a Senior Member of IEEE.

Selected list before 2020 (prior to starting faculty position):

[IoT-J'19] Improving IoT data quality in mobile crowd sensing: A cross validation approach [DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2019.2904704]
T. Luo, J. Huang, S. S. Kanhere, J. Zhang, and S. K. Das
IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IoT-J), vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 5651-5664, June 2019.

A cross validation (CV) approach that seeks a validating crowd to ratify the quality of sensor data contributed by the a contributing crowd. By making an exploration-exploitation tradeoff, a unified solution is offered to two disparate cases: reinforce obscure truth and discover hidden truth. (See illustration.)
[ICC'18] Distributed anomaly detection using autoencoder neural networks in WSN for IoT [DOI: 10.1109/ICC.2018.8422402]
T. Luo and S. Nagarajan
IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), May 2018.

This paper is the first that introduces autoencoder neural networks (ANN), a deep learning model, into wireless sensor networks (WSN) for distributed anomaly detection. It contradicts the general belief that deep learning is not suitable for WSN, by (1) making deep learning extremely shallow and (2) dividing and allocating computation load to sensors and the IoT cloud with a two-part algorithm. (See illustration.)
[AAIM'18] Achieving location truthfulness in rebalancing supply-demand distribution for bike sharing [DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-04618-7_21]
H. Lv, F. Wu, T. Luo, X. Gao, and G. Chen
12th International Conference on Algorithmic Aspects in Information and Management (AAIM), pp. 256-267, December 2018.
Best Student Paper Award (2%; 1/50)
[ComMag'17] Sustainable incentives for mobile crowdsensing: Auctions, lotteries, and trust and reputation systems [DOI: 10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600746CM]
T. Luo, S. S. Kanhere, J. Huang, S. K. Das, and F. Wu
IEEE Communications Magazine, vol. 55, no. 3, pp. 68-74, March 2017.

This survey paper provides a technical overview and analysis of six incentive mechanism design frameworks: auction, lottery, trust and reputation system, bargaining game, contract theory, and market-driven mechanism.
[TIST'16] Incentive mechanism design for crowdsourcing: an all-pay auction approach [pdf] [DOI: 10.1145/2837029]
T. Luo, S. K. Das, H-P. Tan, and L. Xia
ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), vol. 7, no. 3, pp. 35:1-26, February 2016.

The most adopted auctions in incentive mechanism design so far have been winner-pay auctions (WPA), in which only winners (who outbid others and will therefore receive reward) need to pay their bids. By contrast, all-pay auctions (APA) require all the participants regardless of who win the auction to pay their bids. This apparently sounds unreasonable, but when applied to crowdsourcing, it makes perfect sense and gains two important advantages over WPA. (This paper builds on our INFOCOM'14 paper.)
[TMC'16] Incentive mechanism design for heterogeneous crowdsourcing using all-pay contests [DOI: 10.1109/TMC.2015.2485978]
T. Luo, S. S. Kanhere, S. K. Das, and H-P. Tan
IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC), vol. 15, no. 9, pp. 2234-2246, September 2016.

Despite that crowdworkers are typically heterogeneous (in abilities, costs, etc.), the daunting challenge of modeling and analyzing such scenarios has restricted researchers to choosing homogeneous models in which all the worker types follow a single, common distribution (Bayesian belief). This paper addresses this challenge using an asymmetric all-pay auction model with a prize tuple. Not only does it achieve better performance, but it also uncovers a counter-intuitive and interesting property called strategy autonomy, in which the asymmetric equilibrium collapses into a symmetric one.
[INFOCOM'15] Crowdsourcing with Tullock contests: A new perspective [DOI: 10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218641]
T. Luo, S. S. Kanhere, H-P. Tan, F. Wu, and H. Wu
The 34th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), April 2015, pp. 2515-2523.
Acceptance rate: 19% (316/1640)
Best Paper Award finalist (0.3%; 5/1640)
What is a Tullock contest? Think it as a lucky draw! While auctions have dominated the realm of mechanism design for decades, this paper suggests Tullock contests as a better alternative, on the basis that it is less competitive and more conducive to larger participation.
[INFOCOM'14] Profit-maximizing incentive for participatory sensing [DOI: 10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847932] [Much enhanced version: ACM TIST'16]
T. Luo, H-P. Tan, and L. Xia
The 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), April 2014, pp. 127-135.
Acceptance rate: 19% (319/1650)

All-pay auction + adaptive prize/reward (see the short abstract of TIST'16 or an illustration).
[ICTC'12] Enhancing Responsiveness and Scalability for OpenFlow Networks via Control-Message Quenching [DOI: 10.1109/ICTC.2012.6386857]
T. Luo, H-P. Tan, P. C. Quan, Y-W. Law, and J. Jin
International Conference on Infocom Technology Convergence (ICTC), October 2012, pp. 348-353.
Best Paper Award (0.7%; 3/423)
[CommLett'12] Sensor OpenFlow: Enabling Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks
T. Luo, H-P. Tan, and Q.S. Quek
IEEE Communications Letters, vol. 16, no. 11, pp. 1896-1899, November 2012.

This work is the first that introduces software-defined networking (SDN) into wireless sensor networks, where a Sensor OpenFlow protocol within a SD-WSN architecture was proposed.
[TMC'12] Energy-Efficient Strategies for Cooperative Multi-Channel MAC Protocols [Bib]
T. Luo, M. Motani, and V. Srinivasan
