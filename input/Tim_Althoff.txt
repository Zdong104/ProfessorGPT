Description: Tim Althoff

The goal of my research is to better understand and empower people through data.

My research develops computational methods that leverage large-scale behavioral data to extract actionable insights about our lives, health and happiness through combining techniques from data science, social network analysis, and natural language processing.

I direct the Behavioral Data Science Group which works on research related to mental health, misinformation, scientific reproducibility, and public health including informing the COVID-19 response.



We are always looking for great postdocs.

I am also looking for PhD students, especially in but not limited to neural representation learning, NLP and applications to psychology and mental health, causal inference, data science, and mobile health. If you're interested please apply to the UW Allen School.
Go Dawgs!
