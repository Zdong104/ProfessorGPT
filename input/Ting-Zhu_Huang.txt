General
I am an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (CSEE) at University of Maryland Baltimore County. I received NSF CAREER award in 2017. I have dual appointments and am advising students in both the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) program and Computer Science (CS) program. I'm looking for visiting scholars, Master's, and Ph.D. students to work in Energy, Systems, Big Data, Communications and Networking. Please contact me if you are interested.
