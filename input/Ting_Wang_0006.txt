About Me

I am Associate Professor and Empire Innovation Scholar in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University. I conduct research at the interface of machine learning, privacy and security, and aim to develop safe and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Specifically, my recent work focuses on improving AI methods and systems along three major thrusts:

Security Assurance – resilient against malicious manipulations
Privacy Preservation – respectful for individual privacy
Decision-Making Transparency – interpretable to human perception

Before joining Stony Brook, I was Associate Professor in the College of IST at Penn State. I finished my Ph.D. at Georgia Tech and my undergrad study at Zhejiang University.

Team

I lead the Algorithmic Learning, Privacy, and Security (ALPS) lab, where I am privileged to work alongside a team of exceptional talents, both in the past and present:

Current Members – Ren Pang, Changjiang Li, Jiacheng Liang, Tanqiu Jiang, Ziyi Yin (co-supervised with Fenglong Ma), Zian Wang, Lauren Hong

Alumni – Tianyu Du (» Assistant Professor@Zhejiang University), Zhaohan Xi (» Assistant Professor@Binghamton University), Xinyang Zhang (» Senior Engineer@Google), Tinghao Xie (» Ph.D.@Princeton), Zheng Zhang (» Ph.D.@Northwestern), Ningfei Wang (» Ph.D.@UC Irvine), Yujie Ji (» Engineer@Amazon), Sam Nguyen (» Engineer@Google), Yifan Huang (» Engineer@Bloomberg)

Join Us! – We are ALWAYS looking for motivated and bright (under)grad students and postdocs. If you know how to build/hack AI systems, we should talk! Please email me your resume and set up a time to discuss your potential fit to our team.
