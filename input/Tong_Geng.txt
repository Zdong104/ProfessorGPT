About Tony

MY BACKGROUND

Dr. Tony Geng is a tenure-track assistant professor in the ECE and CS departments of the University of Rochester (UR) and the director of UR's IntelliArch Lab. He also holds secondary appointments with the Goergen Institute for Data Science. Before joining Rochester, Tony worked in the Physical & Computational Sciences Directorate (PCSD) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) operated by the Department of Energy of the US government. His research interests are at the intersection of Computer Architecture & Systems, Generative AI, Graph Intelligence, and High-Performance Computing. Tony's papers have appeared in many prestigious conferences and journals e.g. ISCA, MICRO, HPCA, OSDI, ICLR, ICML, NIPS, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, DAC, SC, TPDS, TC, and TIP.

To prospective students:

I am currently looking for two Ph.D. students and one PostDoc to work on next-generation hardware architectures & systems for future Generative AI, graph intelligence, and their applications. Please drop me an email with your CV and transcripts if you are interested.
