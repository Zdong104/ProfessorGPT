Description: Torsten Suel
Professor
Computer Science & Engineering
Tandon School of Engineering
New York University

I am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Tandon School of Engineering of New York University. I received a Diplom degree from the Technical University of Braunschweig in Germany, and an MS and Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. Before joining the faculty in the Fall of 1998, I held postdoctoral positions at the NEC Research Institute and Bell Labs. I was on leave during 2008, working at Yahoo! Research in Santa Clara, CA.

Current Research Opportunities: I may have an open positions for Ph.D. student in my group for Fall 2025. Applicants should have very strong academic backgrounds, significant research experience, and a passion for pursuing research in information retrieval and closely related areas. I am also looking for strong undergraduate and MS students who are interested in pursuing research -- but note these opportunities are limited to current students at NYU. If interested, contact me -- after reading this.

	

COURSE OFFERINGS:
CS6083 - Principles of Database Systems   syllabus   (offered in Spring 2024)
CS6913 - Web Search Engines   syllabus   (next offered in Fall 2024)

RESEARCH:

My research interests are in web search and information retrieval, databases, data compression, and distributed computing. I spend most of my efforts working with the graduate and undergraduate students in my research group, where we explore new techniques and architectures for web search and related problems. In addition, I occasionally do some work in the other areas above, including work on data compression, spatial databases, sequential algorithms, and effcient communication and computation in computer networks.

My main research area is search engine architecture, and particularly how to improve the efficiency of query processing in large engines that have to process billions of queries per day over trillions of documents. This work was recently funded by the National Science Foundation under grants "III-1117829: Efficient Query Processing in Large Search Engines" (project page) and "III-1718680: Index Sharding and Query Routing in Distributed Search Engines" (project page). My current work mostly focuses on the impact of transformers and LLMs on future search architectures.

Student Research Opportunities: I usually have a few research topics available for highly motivated students who want to do research under my supervision, e.g., as part of a senior project or MS thesis. But please read this first before contacting me about research opportunities.

	

TEACHING:

I usually teach CS6083 (Database Systems) and CS6913 (Web Search Engines). Other courses I have taught over the years are Advanced Database Systems, and basic and advanced courses in Operating Systems and in Algorithms.
