Description: Tuo Zhao 赵拓	
	

I am an Assistant Professor (Associate Professor starting in Aug. 2024) of ISyE and CSE (By Courtesy) at Georgia Tech. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University.

My research focuses on methodologies and theories of machine learning, especially deep learning. My recent efforts have been primarily dedicated to Large Language Models, collaborating closely with Microsoft and Amazon.

I am working with talented alchemists in the FLASH (Foundations of LeArning Systems for alcHemy) group. If you are interested in joining my group, please see more information here.
