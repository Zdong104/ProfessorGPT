BRIEF BIO

Tushar Krishna is an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. He is currently also a Visiting Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. He held the ON Semiconductor (Endowed) Junior Professorship in the School of ECE at Georgia Tech from 2019-2021. He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT (2014), a M.S.E in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University (2009), and a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi (2007). Before joining Georgia Tech in 2015, Dr. Krishna spent a year as a researcher at the VSSAD group at Intel, Massachusetts.

Dr. Krishna’s research spans computer architecture, interconnection networks, networks-on-chip (NoC), and AI/ML accelerator systems – with a focus on optimizing data movement in modern computing platforms. His research is funded via multiple awards from NSF, DARPA, IARPA, SRC (including JUMP2.0), Department of Energy, Intel, Google, Meta/Facebook, Qualcomm and TSMC. His papers have been cited over 16,000 times. Three of his papers have been selected for IEEE Micro’s Top Picks from Computer Architecture, one more received an honorable mention, and four have won best paper awards.

Dr. Krishna was inducted into the HPCA Hall of Fame in 2022. At Georgia Tech, he has been honored by the “Class of 1940 Course Survey Teaching Effectiveness Award” in 2018, the “Roger P. Webb Outstanding Junior Faculty Award” from the School of ECE in 2021, the “Richard M. Bass/Eta Kappa Nu Outstanding Junior Teacher Award” in 2023, and the “Roger P. Webb Outstanding Mid-career Faculty Award” from the School of ECE in 2024.

Dr. Krishna currently serves as an Associate Director for the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH) – a cross-disciplinary research center at Georgia Tech. He is also a co-chair of the Chakra Execution Traces and Benchmarks Working group within ML Commons.
