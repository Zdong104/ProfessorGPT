CV

I am an assistant professor at the CSE department of UCSD, working with awesome people at the Center for Visual Computing. I explore the connections between visual computing algorithms and modern data-driven methods and develop programming languages and systems for facilitating the exploration. I did a 2-year postdoc with Jonathan Ragan-Kelley at both MIT CSAIL and UC Berkeley. I did my Ph.D. in the computer graphics group at MIT CSAIL, advised by Frédo Durand. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science and information engineering from National Taiwan University in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where I worked with Yung-Yu Chuang at the Communication and Multimedia Lab.
