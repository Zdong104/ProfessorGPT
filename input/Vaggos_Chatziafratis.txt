As of July 2021, I've joined UC Santa Cruz as an Assistant Professor in the CSE department. During the academic year 2021-2022 (on leave), I was a postdoc at Northwestern mentored by Samir Khuller, Aravindan Vijayaraghavan and Kostya Makarychev. In January 2022, I joined MIT/Northeastern as a FODSI fellow.



Prior to this, I had spent a wonderful year at Google Research in New York hosted by Mohammad Mahdian and Vahab Mirrokni. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University, where I had the privilege to be advised by Tim Roughgarden and co-advised by Moses Charikar. My thesis was on Hierarchical Clustering.

Prior to Stanford, I received my Diploma in EECS from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece.
