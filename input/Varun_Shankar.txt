As of July 1, 2023, I am an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) in the Kahlert School of Computing (KSoC) at the University of Utah. My primary research focus is on the development of efficient, scalable, and provably-accurate machine learning models for scientific applications. This research lies at the intersection of scientific machine learning, scientific computing, and high performance computing.

I am not currently recruiting PhD students.

From July 2018 to June 2023, I was an Assistant Professor Lecturer (non tenure-track) in KSoC. My primary responsibilities involved teaching, TA coordination, and devloping curriculum materials for the Master of Software Development (MSD) program within KSoC. I currently serve as Associate Director of the MSD program. I have co-advised MS and PhD students in KSoC and Math for many years.

I obtained my PhD in Computing (with a focus on Scientific Computing) from KSoC and also did a 4 year postdoc in the Math Biology group in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Utah.
