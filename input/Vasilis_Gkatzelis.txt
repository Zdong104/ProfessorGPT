Vasilis Gkatzelis
 	I am an associate professor of computer science at the College of Computing & Informatics of Drexel University and a member of the Drexel EconCS research group. During the first half of 2024, I will be on sabbatical at Google Research.

Previous Appointments:
Spring 2016: postdoc at UC Berkeley hosted by Christos Papadimitriou and Eric Friedman
Fall 2015: research fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley
2013-2015: postdoc at Stanford University hosted by Tim Roughgarden
Education:
PhD (2013): Courant Institute of New York University (advised by Richard Cole)
Diploma (2007): Computer Engineering and Informatics of University of Patras
During my PhD I also had the opportunity to work as an intern for:
Microsoft Research in Mountain View, CA
HP Labs in Palo Alto, CA
Google in New York, NY
