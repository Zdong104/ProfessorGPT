Papers and slides from various presentations.
I am a Professor of the Graduate School at UC Berkeley, based out of the EECS Department (where I also have a web presence), and was the leader of the Networking and Security Group at ICSI.
I am also a founder of Corelight, a startup that grew out of the Zeek Project.
At UCB I taught undergraduate Computer Security and Introduction to Communication Networks, graduate Internet/Network Security, and an experimental course, Empirical Analysis.

I'm currently advising one Ph.D. student, Julien Piet, and in the past I served as a Ph.D. advisor or co-advisor for students at a number of institutes:

Biography

I received my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, and have been (and continue to be) a staff scientist with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Network Research Group for many years. I began at the networking group of the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in 1999.

Some of my main active research projects are CESR and Bro. The former reflects a continuation of my extensive collaboration with Stefan Savage, Geoff Voelker, and their research group at UC San Diego.

My professional activities include:

Steering committee member for USENIX ENIGMA and the USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet.
Program committee member for ACM CCS '15, USENIX ENIGMA '16 USENIX FOCI '15 and ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Crowdsourcing and crowdsharing of Big (Internet) Data (C2B(I)D) 2015.

Some former activities:

Chair of the IRTF, 2001-2005
Vice-chair of ACM SIGCOMM, 2003-2007
Co-founder and steering committee member for the Internet Measurement Conference 2001-2004
Co-founder and steering committee member of USENIX Workshop on Large-Scale Exploits and Emergent Threats.
Program co-chair for HotNets 2007
Program co-chair of the 2005 and 2006 IEEE Symposia on Security and Privacy
Program chair for the 2nd Workshop on Rapid Malcode (WORM)
Co-founder and steering committee member of Workshop on Rapid Malcode
Invited talks co-chair for USENIX Security 2004
Organizer, 2003 DIMACS Workshop on Large-Scale Internet Attacks (some viewgraphs from the workshop)
Program chair for USENIX Security 2003
Program co-chair for SIGCOMM 2002
Editorial board, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2000-2004
Member of the IESG 1998-2000
