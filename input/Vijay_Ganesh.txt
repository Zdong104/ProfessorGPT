Vijay Ganesh is a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech. Prior to joining Georgia Tech in 2023, Vijay was a professor at the University of Waterloo from 2012 to 2023, where he also served as a Co-Director of the Waterloo AI Institute from 2021 to 2023. From 2007 to 2012, Vijay was a research scientist at MIT. He completed his computer science PhD from Stanford University in 2007. The primary focus of Vijay's research is the theory and practice of SAT/SMT solvers and their applications in software engineering, security, AI, mathematics, and physics. Vijay currently leads the following projects:

1. Machine Learning (ML) for Logic (Solvers)
    MapleSAT
    AlphaMapleSAT
    Z3Alpha
    Meta-solving
    Z3str* solvers
    Parallel SAT for cryptanalysis
2. Logic for ML
