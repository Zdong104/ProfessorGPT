I am a Professor in the Department of Biostatistics with appointments in the Computer Sciences department and the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am also a (part-time) Faculty Researcher at Google Deepmind. My primary research focus is Image analysis and includes topics in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis. I am in the UW Computer Vision group and the Imaging Core of Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (W-ADRC). Our group led the Neuroimaging core in the Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping and is affiliated with Machine Learning@UW.



Research Summary

My group's overarching research goal is to develop novel models and algorithms to solve real image (and data) analysis problems in scientific, biomedical, engineering or industrial applications. We often focus on developing algorithms (by extending or adapting ideas from statistics, geometry or optimization) whose mathematical properties can be analyzed and then providing open-source tools to benefit the scientific or industrial application that initiated the work.

Look at our published papers to see what we are currently working on. If you're interested in joining my group, please read this information for potential student collaborators. For industrial consultation requests, please read this note.
