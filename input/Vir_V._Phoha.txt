FIELD Engineering Technology
EXPERTISE Biometrics Cybersecurity Machine Learning Smart Phone And Tablet Security

My focus is to do original research that cuts across conventional rigorously defined disciplines and unifies basic and common concepts across disciplines.  In particular, my research centers around security (malignant systems, active authentication, for example touch based authentication on mobile devices) and machine learning (decision trees, statistical, and evolutionary methods) with a focus on large time series data streams and static data sets, and computer networks (anomalies, optimization).  I am also using these methods to build field realizable defensive and offensive Cyber-based systems.
