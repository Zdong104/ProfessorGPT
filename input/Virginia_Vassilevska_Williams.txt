My research applies combinatorial and graph theoretic tools to various computational domains. My recent work has focused on the following domains:
designing algorithms for shortest paths, pattern detection and other computational problems in graphs and matrices,
reducing fundamental computational problems to one another in a fine-grained way, sometimes showing equivalences,
studying how much graph distance information can be compressed, and
computational issues in social choice: when and how can one efficiently manipulate elections, tournaments and competitions, how to measure the quality of a voting rule, etc.

	Some info and short bio:
I am originally from Sofia, Bulgaria, where I (mostly) lived until 1999 when I graduated from the amazing German Language High School in Sofia.
As a child, I spent two years in the USA, and I learned English then. I came back to the US for college. In 2003 I graduated from Caltech with B.S. in Mathematics and Eng. and Applied Science (there was no CS degree at the time).
After Caltech, I went to Carnegie Mellon University where in 2008 I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science under Prof. Guy Blelloch.
After CMU I spent a year as a postdoctoral member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in Avi Wigderson's group.
Between 2009 and 2011 I was a Computing Innovations Fellow at UC Berkeley, working with Prof. Satish Rao.
After that, I spent two years as a part-time Research Associate at Stanford 2011-2013, and a part-time Assistant Research Engineer at Berkeley.
In 2013 I joined the Computer Science Department at Stanford University as an Assistant Professor.
In early 2017, I moved to MIT as an Associate Professor in EECS. I earned tenure in 2019, and am now a full professor.
