Vishnu Naresh Boddeti is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University (MSU) and the Director of the Human Analysis Lab

Research Interests:

Modern machine learning systems are critically dependent on data representations. My research in this area focuses on designing computationally and statistically efficient algorithms for learning such representations and understanding their behavior through concepts such as convergence, complexity, privacy, fairness, and security. I am specifically interested in developing novel modeling paradigms that afford explicit control over the semantic information content in a representation. My research agenda is directly motivated by and contributes to applications in machine learning, computer vision, biometric recognition, and medical imaging.

Hiring: I am always looking for motivated students with strong mathematical backgrounds. Please read this before sending me an email. Otherwise, do not expect a reply. I value people who are attentive to details.
