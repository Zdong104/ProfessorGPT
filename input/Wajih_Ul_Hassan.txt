About Me
I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia (UVA). My research primarily revolves around system security. I specialize in building practical solutions for safeguarding complex networked computer systems, leveraging both novel data-driven approaches and scalable system design. I lead the DART Lab at UVA. My work was recognized with the NSF CAREER Award in 2024.

I am currently looking for 1-2 Ph.D. students to join my research lab. If you are interested in system security research and would like to work with me, please do not hesitate to send me an email.
