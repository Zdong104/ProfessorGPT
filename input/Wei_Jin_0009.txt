Hi there! I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Emory University. I obtained my Ph.D. from Michigan State University in 2023 under the supervision of Prof. Jiliang Tang. Prior to that, I completed my B.E. degree at Zhejiang University in 2019. I have notable accomplishments such as KAUST Rising Stars in AI, AAAI New Faculty Highlights, Snap Research Fellowship, Most Influential Papers in KDD and WWW by PaperDigest, SDM Best Poster Award Honorable Mention, Fitch H. Beach Award, and top finishes in three NeurIPS competitions. In addition, I regularly serve as organizers, (senior) PC members, and reviewers for multiple international conferences and journals in machine learning and data science such as ICLR, KDD, ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS, AAAI, IJCAI, WWW, WSDM, CIKM, TPAMI, TKDE, TKDD and TNNLS.

[Recruiting Ph.D. students and interns] I am actively seeking highly-motivated students for Ph.D. or Research Intern positions. If you are interested, please send me your CV, transcripts, and brief descriptions about why you want to work with me. Due to the substantial volume of emails I receive daily, I would like to apologize in advance as I may not be able to respond to each of them. I appreciate your understanding.

Research Interests:

Graph Neural Networks, Graph Machine Learning
Data-Centric AI (a nice definition by Andrew Ng)
Trustworthy AI: Robustness, Privacy, Fairness
AI for Science, AI for Healthcare

Personal

I enjoy many different kinds of sports including running, basketball, ping-pong and tennis. During my undergrad, I got several champions in 400m, 400m hurdles and 4*400m relay races at the university sports meet.

Now my goal is to bulk up and hopefully get a certificate of personal trainer. Let’s see what will happen 5 4 3 2 years later :)
