Wei Niu is an assistant professor in the School of Computing at the University of Georgia. He obtained his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at William & Mary, under the supervision of Dr. Bin Ren. Prior to that, he earned a B.S. Degree in Software Engineering from Beihang University in 2016 and worked as a mobile-platform software developer at Bytedance Ltd. from 2016 to 2018. His research interests include:

Real-time machine learning systems
AGI on embedded devices
Parallel computing
Compiler optimization

His work has been published in some high-impact conferences (MICRO, PLDI, ASPLOS, ICS, ICCV, CVPR, AAAI, NIPS, ECCV, DAC, ASP-DAC, GLSVLSI) and journals (TPAMI, CACM).

Realtime AI Application on Mobile Devices

Wei Niu also designed several creative real-time AI-applications on mobile devices based on his research, here are some examples:

Network style transfer
YOLO-V3/YOLO-V4 object detection
Super resolution
Black-white image/video coloring
3D object detection (based on R2+1D, C3D, S3D models)
