I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at UTSA. I got my PhD from University of Virginia in 2015.

My research falls in the intersection of the areas of system software, cloud computing, computer architecture and software engineering. More specifically, my research is about optimizing the performance and energy efficiency of large-scale computing systems with new system software, hardware and software developing techniques.
