I am a WiSE Gabilan Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I am broadly interested in software engineering, software security, and computer systems. My work aims to build testing and analysis techniques for improving the reliability, security, and efficiency of complex software systems. I was awarded a University at Buffalo Exceptional Scholar - Young Investigator Award in 2022, an NSF CAREER Award in 2021, a Facebook Testing and Verification Research Award in 2019, a Mozilla Research Award in 2019, and a Maurice H. Halstead Memorial Research Award in 2018. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Purdue University in 2018.
