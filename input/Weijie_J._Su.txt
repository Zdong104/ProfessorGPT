Recent News

My paper of the equi-separation law with Hangfeng He was just accepted by PNAS.


Paper1 and Paper2 introduce a truthful mechanism for eliciting information from an ‘oracle owner’ for better estimation.


This method, referred to as the Isotonic Mechanism, was recently experimented at ICML 2023 via OpenRank.

Our new paper shows that the Isotonic Mechanism can handle review scores with variances depending on means.

This new paper extends the Isotonic Mechanism to the setting of multiple coauthors.


I received the 2022 Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) Peter Gavin Hall Early Career Prize.


I received the inaugural 2022 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Early Career Prize in Data Science.


Our new paper introduces a simple model that sheds light on how implicit regularization, information bottleneck, and local elasticity arise simultaneously in deep learning.


Our paper Exploring Deep Neural Networks via Layer-Peeled Model: Minority Collapse in Imbalanced Training is now out in PNAS.
