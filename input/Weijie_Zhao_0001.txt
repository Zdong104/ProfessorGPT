Bio
I received my Ph.D. under the supervision of Professor Florin Rusu and am hornored to be part of the academic tree from Avi and Raghu. Before joining RIT, I was a researcher in Baidu Research USA. At Baidu, I worked with Ping Li to investigate exciting problems in big data and machine learning systems. I'm working on scalable machine learning systems, approximate nearest neighbor search, security in machine learning, scientific data processing, and database systems.
