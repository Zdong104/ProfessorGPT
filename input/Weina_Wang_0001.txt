About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie in the broad area of applied probability, with a focus on decision-making in large stochastic systems. I have worked on problems in queueing systems, bandits, and reinforcement learning. Many of the problem formulations I have studied are motivated by resource orchestration in modern computing systems. I have also worked on large random graphs, with a focus on characterizing statistical limits and computational limits, and data privacy, especially at its intersection with information theory and game theory. My research is driven by a dual objective: to understand fundamental limits, and to design algorithms and approaches to achieve them.

Bio

I joined the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2018 as an Assistant Professor. Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Arizona State University, working with Prof. R. Srikant and Prof. Lei Ying. I received my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University in 2016, advised by Prof. Lei Ying and Prof. Junshan Zhang. I received my Bachelor’s degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University in 2009. My dissertation received the Dean’s Dissertation Award in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University in 2016 (news article). I received the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award at ACM SIGMETRICS 2016, the Best Paper Award at ACM MobiHoc 2022, an NSF CAREER Award in 2022, and the ACM SIGMETRICS Rising Star Research Award in 2023.
