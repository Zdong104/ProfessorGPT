Weiyi Meng is a SUNY Distinguished Service Professor. Since 2016, he has been the chair of the Computer Science Department at Binghamton University. He served as an Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies of the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science from August 2014 to June 2016. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from University of Illinois at Chicago in 1992 and joined the department as a faculty member in the same year. His research interests include metasearch engines, Web database integration, Internet-based information retrieval, Web data quality, Web information extraction, sentiment analysis, and database management systems. He has done pioneering work in large-scale metasearch engines. He is the co-author of three books (Principles of Database Query Processing for Advanced Applications, Advanced Metasearch Engine Technology and Deep Web Query Interface Understanding and Integration). He has published over 150 papers and many of them in top conferences and journals in his research areas, including ACM SIGMOD, VLDB, IEEE ICDE, WWW, KDD, ACM SIGIR, ACM TODS, ACM TOIS, ACM TWEB, and IEEE TKDE. His publications have been cited more than 9,000 times according to Google Scholar and his H-Index is 47. He is recognized as a top computer scientist in the United States (Research.com). He has served as a member of the program/organizing committees of more than 100 international conferences, as a conference/program committee chair for some of them. He has also served on the editorial boards of several journals.
