Description: Weizi Li / 李玮孜

I am Assistant Professor in the Min H. Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

I was Michael Hammer Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT and I received my Ph.D. from the UNC Chapel Hill, working with Ming C. Lin. I have also spent time at Disney Research, Lenovo Research, National University of Singapore, and George Mason University.

I am passionate about using simulation and machine learning (especially reinforcement learning) to design and develop next-gen cyber-physical infrastructure for urban environments. The main themes of my current research are transportation autonomy and urban mobility.

My projects are supported by National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Transportation, Nvidia, and Center for Transportation Research.
