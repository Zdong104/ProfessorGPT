Biography

I am actively looking for self-motivated students at all levels (BS/MS/PhD) with relevant backgrounds. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out!

I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte. My research interests are at the intersection of robotics, control theory, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Specifically, my research focuses on principled methods for robust and interactive autonomy that enable robots to safely and effectively collaborate with each other and with humans in the physical world.

Prior to joining UNC Charlotte, I completed my PhD in Robotics at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University in July 2021, where I was advised by Katia Sycara. I also spent two summers in 2019 and 2020 as a research intern at Microsoft Research collaborating with Ashish Kapoor.

Research Interests

I am broadly interested in robotics, control theory and artificial intelligence. Within robotics, my subdisciplinary interests lie in planning, coordination and learning for autonomous and adaptive robotic systems, such as multi-robot systems and human-robot systems, with emphasis on safety, robustness, trustworthiness and adversaries in the systems.
