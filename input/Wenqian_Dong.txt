Wenqian Dong
Assistant Professor in KFSCIS department at Florida International University.
She received her Ph.D. in EECS from University of California, Merced under the mentorship of Prof. Dong Li in 2022, M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Hunan University in 2017, and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Hunan Agriculture University in 2015.

She worked in the High-Performance Computing Group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and AI Labs at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Her work at PNNL was highlighted at DOE News wise and PNNL website .

​Her research interests include high-performance computing (HPC), scientific machine learning, automatic performance tuning, and system-level optimization for large-scale ML models. Her work has been published in multiple top-tier conferences, including SC, HPDC, ASPLOS, ICS, EuroSys, VLDB, etc. Also, she is the recipient of the IEEE Computer Society TCHPC Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence in High-Performance Computing (2023) and the Bobcat Fellowship at UC Merced (2020 and 2018).


[News:] If you are interested in applying to the Ph.D. program (open for graduates/senior undergrads) in my group or remote research intern (open for undergrads) from my group, please send your CV and transcript to me.
