CV [Updated Dec 2023]


I am an assistant professor in CMU's Computer Science Department. I have a courtesy apoointment in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, and am also a core faculty in CyLab. I am also a co-founder of Opaque Systems.

I am broadly interested in system security and applied cryptography: I like to build secure systems, develop practical cryptographic primitives and protocols, and design systems for democratizing and accelerating cryptography. Recently, I've been fascinated with building practical systems for secure outsourced computation in the cloud, secure collaborative computation among mutually distrusting parties, and more practical private information retrieval systems. I believe that a combination of systems and advanced cryptography can not only make existing applications more secure, but also enable new applications.

Previously, I was a Ph.D. student in the UC Berkeley RISE Lab, where I was co-advised by Raluca Ada Popa and Ion Stoica. I received my bachelor and M.Eng. degrees at MIT, where I was advised by Barbara Liskov.

I was also a co-founder and an organizer for DARE, a diversity-focused program for matching undergraduates to research opportunities.

My research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation, AWS, Cisco, CMU CyLab, Google, and Samsung. Thank you!
