Short Bio Research Publications Grants Tools Teaching Vita

I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at NC State University, co-director of the Secure Computing Institute, director of the Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR) laboratory, and a member of the Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2). I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Pennsylvania State University in 2011 and 2006, respectively, and my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Penn State in 2004.

My research studies the security of a wide range of systems, including the software supply chain, 5G and cloud infrastructure, mobile platforms, Internet of Things (IoT), and networks. I commonly apply a range of systems design, program analysis, and empirical studies to demonstrate how novel techniques and tools can improve the security of our computing systems. (Short Bio)
