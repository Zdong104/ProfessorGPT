William S. Moses
Assistant Professor, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)

I'm an incoming professor at UIUC (starting 2024) in the Computer Science department, and Electrical and Computer Engineering department (by courtesy). Previously, I was a PhD candidate and undergrad at MIT studying computer science and physics. Before that, I attended Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) in Northern Virginia. My group has multiple PhD positions available for Fall 2024. If you are interested in compilers or high performance computing, including with applications to machine learning, climate science, databases, security, or biology, please reach out and apply to the Computer Science department at UIUC (I can also advise students from other departments).
