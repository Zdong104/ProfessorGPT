Short Bio
Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at University of Delaware. My research focuses on machine learning, computer vision, and safe learning system.

I'm interested in how to make AI systems more reliable and trustworthy, particularly for high-stake use in science, medicine, and autonomous driving.

I lead the Deep-REAL (Deep Robust & Explainable AI Lab) at UD. My groups publish in top-tier AI/ML venues including NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI, IJCAI, KDD, and TPAMI. According to csrankings.org, I am the top-ranked individual in the CIS Department and the second-best scholar in Computer Science at UD. 

My research are supported by NSF, DoD, CDC, MSK Cancer Center, Google Research, Snap Research, and UD. My work received prestigious awards for young investigators: NSF CAREER Award, DoD DEPSCoR Award, Google Faculty Research Award, and UD Research Foundation Award.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rutgers University in 2018. My advisor is the Chair and Distinguished Professor Dimitris N. Metaxas. Before that, I received my M.S. degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011, and my B.S. degree from Beihang University in 2008. I was a full-time software engineer at Baidu (Beijing) in 2011, and summer interns at IBM Watson (NY) in 2015 and NEC Labs America (CA) in 2016.  

Research Interests

Safe Learning System: My research focuses on developing reliable, explainable, and scalable models, algorithms, and theory foundations. 

Robust Optimization: Tackle out-of-distribution (OoD) data due to distributional shifts in complex and dynamic environments.

Rationale Optimization: Safeguard AI predictions not only accurate but also anchored by valid rationales.

--- ECCV'24, CVPR'23, NeurIPSW'21 Best Paper, ICLR'21 Spotlight, ICCV'19 Oral, NeurIPS'19, KDD'19 Oral

Scalable Learning: Optimize to for modern HPC platform to manage the rapidly growing of data and model.

--- ICML'24, ICCV'23, CVPR'22, AAAI'21, CVPR'22, CVPR'21, CVPR'20, CVPR'19

Safety-critical Applications: The goal is to pioneer safe learning systems for critical domains where safety and reliability cannot be compromised.

AI for Sciences: Flooding segmentation; Seafloor mapping and characterization; Illicit mining detection.

Medical: AI-assisted MRI interpretation; Prostate cancer diagnosis; Roofing biomechanics.

Autonomous Driving: Hardware fault tolerant learning system.
