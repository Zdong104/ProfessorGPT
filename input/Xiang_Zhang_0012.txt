ABOUT ME
XIANG ZHANG 

Xiang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Charlotte. Before joining UNC Charlotte, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University from March 2020 to July 2022. Xiang received his Ph.D. degree (in 2020) in Computer Science from the University of New South Wales (UNSW). His research interests lie in data mining and machine learning with applications in pervasive healthcare, medical time series, and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Xiang's research outcomes have been published in prestigious conferences (such as ICLR, NeurIPS, and KDD) and journals (like Nature Computational Science).
