CUNY Graduate Center Ph.D. Program in Computer Science prepares selected students for leadership positions in research and development careers in computer science and information technology industry, as well as for research and teaching positions in academia institutions. Our Ph.D. candidates master the computer science discipline in its broadest sense, in the same time obtain in depth knowledge of a specialized area and perform independent innovative research in cutting edge fields.

We have over 100 participating faculty members, most of whom are globally recognized scholars.

Learn more about our curriculum and degree information.

STUDENTS

Doctoral students in Computer Science join the program with a record of exceptional work in Computer Science, Mathematics, or related sciences. Throughout their tenure at the Graduate Center, students will conduct their own original research that is publishable in archival peer reviewed journals and conferences, teach at one of the CUNY colleges, and complete their dissertation.

Learn more about admissions and aid and hear from some of our alums.

RESEARCH AREAS

Our research areas include: Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Communication Networks and Computer Systems, Computational Biology, Computational Science and Modeling, Computer and Network Security, Data Science, Logic, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Signal/Image Processing, and Theory.

Our program is also closely tied with the M.S. program in Data Science.

WHY NYC?

New York City is one of the nation's leading high-tech hubs, offering a wide range of research, business, and teaching opportunities. Since the Computer Science program works as a consortium, with most seminars, lectures, and colloquia held at the Graduate Center in midtown Manhattan and many lab-oriented courses held at CUNY's senior colleges spread out amongst the five boroughs, students become familiar with the city and all it has to offer.
