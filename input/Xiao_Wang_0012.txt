About me

I am an assistant professor of computer science at Northwestern University. My research interests include computer security, privacy, and cryptography. Recently, I’m working on practical multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proof, oblivious RAM, and post-quantum cryptography. I like building real systems based on advanced cryptographic techniques and pushing their limits of practicality.
