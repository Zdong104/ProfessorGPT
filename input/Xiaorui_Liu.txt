About Me

Xiaorui Liu has been an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at North Carolina State University since August 2022. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University in 2022 under the supervision of Dr. Jiliang Tang. Before that, he received his Master's and Bachelor's degrees from South China University of Technology. He was awarded the ACM SIGKDD Outstanding Dissertation Award (1st Runner-up) in 2023, Amazon Research Awards in 2023 and 2022, NCSU Data Science Academy Award in 2023, NCSU Faculty Research and Professional Development Award in 2023, Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Students Abroad in 2022, Best Paper Honorable Mention Award at ICHI 2019, MSU Engineering Distinguished Fellowship in 2017, and Cloud Computing Fellowship in 2021. 

His research interests include large-scale machine learning, trustworthy artificial intelligence, and deep learning on graphs/language/vision. He has published innovative works in top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD, AISTATS, and SIGIR. He also organized and co-presented multiple tutorials related to these research topics in KDD 2023, WWW 2022, KDD 2021, IJCAI 2021, and ICAPS 2021. He regularly serves as the organizer, (senior) PC member, and reviewer for top-tier international conferences and journals in machine learning and data science such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, WWW, WSDM, LoG, MLSys, CIKM, JMLR, TPAMI, TMLR, and TNNLS.
