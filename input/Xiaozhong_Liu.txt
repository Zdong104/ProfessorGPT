EDUCATION
PhD in Information Science and Technology from Syracuse University

Dr. Xiaozhong Liu is an Associate Professor at Computer Science and Data Science, WPI. Before that, he was Associate Professor at School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering Indiana University Bloomington. His research interests include natural language processing (NLP), text/graph mining, information retrieval/recommendation, metadata, and computational social science. His dissertation at Syracuse University (advisor Dr. Elizabeth D. Liddy) explored an innovative ranking method that weighted the retrieved results by leveraging dynamic community interests. His recent research is focusing on AI explainability/trustworthiness, natural language generation via deep learning, cybercrime/security, and human-centric data heterogeneity. While active in academia, his research also extends to industry, e.g., he was senior consultant and NLP research director at Alibaba DAMO Academy and led a number of prestigious projects the most cutting-edge and market-driven topics.

I'm actively looking for PhD students with good experience in NLP and/or deep learning.
