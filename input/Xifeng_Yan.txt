I am a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the inventor of PromptDialog, an IDE and DevOps for conversational AI assistants.  I am  working on multimodal language models and exploring them as a knowledge discovery tool across domains such as finance, healthcare, and science.  We have extensively innovated on graph mining, graph data management and unintentionally pioneered transformer-based time series forecasting.

News (Sept 2023) : Our GauchoChat team has won the overall first-place prize for the Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 (SGC5) . We found the weakness of the current large language models (LLMs) including ChatGPT and developed techniques, GauchoChat: Towards proactive, controllable, and personalized social conversation that turns a reactive LLM to a proactive one.

News (June 2023) : Our GauchoAI team has won the second-place prize for the Alexa Simbot Challenge. Our approach is summarized in GauchoAI: A proactive modular embodied AI that collaborates with humans.
