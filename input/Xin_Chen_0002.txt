(Openings for Ph.D. students: I am looking for self-motivated students working on the analysis and synthesis of: (1) large-scale hybrid systems, (2) stochastic processes, (3) AI/ML algorithms.)

Research interests
I am primarily interested in solving the safety and security problems on Cyber-Physical Systems equipped with machine learning components using formal methods.
A graphic overview of my research topics along with some of my representative publications are given as below.
