POSITIONS AVAILABLE 
Postdoctoral Fellow in Machine Learning and Privacy

One postdoctoral position in Machine Learning and Privacy is available in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Temple University. The appointee will support and complement ongoing projects in developing new algorithms for machine learning and privacy-preserving modeling. The appointee will work closely with scientists in the Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine (iGEM) and Center for Data Analytics and Biomedical Informatics at Temple, other institutions in Philadelphia (e.g. Penn Medicine) and beyond (e.g. Stevens Institute of Technology) to develop privacy preserving machine learning methods.

Candidate must have or be close to obtaining a Ph.D. in quantitative fields (include but not limited to Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, and Physics) and have demonstrated a high level of research productivity through publication in peer-reviewed conferences and journals. Experiences with machine learning or data privacy is required. As a team player working closely with cross-institutional scientists with broad areas of expertise, strong interpersonal and communication skills are essential.

Postdoctoral Fellow in Computational Biology / Bioinformatics

One postdoctoral position in computational biology and bioinformatics is available in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Temple University. The appointee will support and complement ongoing projects in developing computational approaches/pipelines to integrate and analyze large-scale (epi)genomic, expression and interaction data sets for scientific discovery and validation. The appointee will work closely with scientists in the Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine (iGEM) and Center for Data Analytics and Biomedical Informatics at Temple, other institutions (e.g. Penn Medicine, Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine) and International Consortium like The Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) to develop new methods and pipelines toward precision medicine.

Candidate must have or be close to obtaining a Ph.D. in quantitative fields (include but not limited to Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, and Physics) and have demonstrated a high level of research productivity through publication in peer-reviewed conferences and journals. Extensive experiences using scripting languages (e.g. Perl, Python) and statistical/mathematical toolkits (e.g. R, SAS, Matlab, Mathematica) are required. Knowledge of machine/statistical learning and mathematical modeling techniques is desirable. As a team player working closely with cross-institutional scientists with broad areas of expertise, strong interpersonal and communication skills are essential.
