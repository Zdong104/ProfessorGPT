Dr. Xintao Wu is the professor and the Charles D. Morgan/Acxiom Endowed Graduate Research Chair in Database and leads Social Awareness and Intelligent Learning (SAIL) Lab in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at University of Arkansas.   He was a Professor (July 2012-June 2014), an Associate Professor (July 2007-June 2012), and an Assistant Professor (August 2001-June 2007) of College of Computing and Informatics and led Data Privacy Lab at University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  

Dr. Wu’s major research interests include data mining, data privacy, fraud detection, fairness aware learning, and big data analysis. His recent research work has focused on 1) trustworthy AI, in particular, fair, privacy preserving, and robust machine learning, 2) causal modeling and inference, in particular, causal representation learning and causal bandits, 3) trustworthy in-context learning of large language models, and 4) data mining applications for tabular data, social network data, bioimaging, and healthcare data.

Dr. Wu has co-authored over 170 scholarly papers, many of which were published in premier conferences such as KDD, WWW, CIKM, ICDM, SDM, IJCAI, AAAI, and NeurIPS, and top journals such as TKDD, TKDE, TDSC, TOSEM, and Machine Learning. He and his students received several awards including PAKDD'09 Best Student Paper Runner-up Award, WISE'12 Challenge Runner-up Award, PAKDD'13 Best Application Paper Award, BIBM13 Best Paper Award, CNS’19 Best Paper Award, and PAKDD’19 Most Influential Paper Award (selected from PAKDD’09 proceedings).

Dr. Wu is/was an associate editor or editorial board member of Springer's Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, InderScience Publisher's International Journal of Social Network Mining, Spanish Higher Research Council's Transaction on Data Privacy, Springer’s Social Network Analysis and Mining, Springer’s Journal of Data Science and Analytics, and Frontiers’ Data Mining & Management,  and has served on numerous NSF review panels and program committees as area chair, senior PC, and PC of top international conferences, including ACM KDD, WWW, CIKM, IEEE ICDM, SIAM SDM, AAAI, IJCAI, PKDD, and PAKDD. He served as the program co-chair of the 23rd IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (2024), the ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Ethical Artificial Intelligence: Methods and Applications (2022-2024), the IEEE International Conference on Big Data (2020) and the 2nd International Symposium on Data, Privacy and E-Commerce (ISDPE'10), publication co-chair of KDD15, and award co-chair of DSAA (2018-2019). Dr. Wu is a recipient of NSF CAREER Award (2006), Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching Award (2005) and Outstanding Faculty Research Award (2009) from College of Computing and Informatics at UNC Charlotte, Outstanding Researcher Award (2016, 2023) from Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering and John L. Imhoff Outstanding Research Award (2023) from College of Engineering at University of Arkansas.

Dr. Wu got his Ph.D. in Information Technology from George Mason University in August 2001. He received his BS degree in Information Science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1994, an ME degree in Computer Engineering from the Chinese Academy of Space Technology in 1997.
