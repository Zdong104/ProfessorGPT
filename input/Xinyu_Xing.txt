To prospective students: I am looking for multiple Ph.D. students and undergraduate/graduate research interns who share my academic interests and have a solid background in OS or system/software security or statistics or PL. We provide full financial support for our PhDs and interns.



About Me and Team (CV)

I am an Associate Professor at Northwestern University and the co-founder of Sec3. My research interest includes OS/AI security. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech under the supervision of Dr. Wenke Lee and Dr. Nick Feamster. My team organizes and participates in CTF frequentlly. You may see many of them in DEFCON CTF. We also frequentlly present at prestigious industrial conferences such as BlackHat, DEFCON, and Pwn2Own in the past years, covering the topics of kernel security, reverse engineering, and AI security etc. In the past years, many of my students received prestigious awards. All the students in our group are super smart, hard-working, and self-motivated. This can be demonstrated by their productive research records and impactful research outcome. I am very fortnuate to work with them. They are more than just my students but colleagues and more importantly great friends.
