Research Interest:
Wireless systems and networking: next-generation wireless network architectures and physical-layer informed mobile applications.
Mobile and ubiquitous computing: ubiquitous and wireless sensing systems for healthcare, mobile interaction, etc.
Research Methodology:
System implementation: on software radios (WARP/USRP), Android, Linux network drivers, and customized hardware platforms.
Theoretical modeling: Signal processing, computational imaging, machine learning, convex optimization, probability models.
News:
Looking for postdoc, research engineer and visiting scholars with experiences in communication hardware and machine learning models. See details here.
I am looking for self-motivated students to work on research projects in wireless networking and mobile computing. Read my "Notes to Prospective Students" if you are interested in joining our research group.
