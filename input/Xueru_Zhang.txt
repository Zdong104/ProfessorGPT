CV

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. I am also affiliated with the Translational Data Analytics Institute.

My research focuses on the societal aspects of machine learning and algorithmic decision-making. I aim to understand the societal implications of machine learning and develop learning systems that are aligned with social norms and reliable in dynamic environments. The research topics of my recent works are: (1) Trustworthy machine learning (e.g., fairness, privacy, security, robustness, interpretability); (2) Learning in uncertain and dynamic environment (e.g., strategic classification, out-of-distribution generalization); (3) Learning from distributed agents (e.g., federated learning); (4) AI for Science (e.g., healthcare, earth sciences). For more details, please see my publications. Our research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation, Cisco, Center for Clinical and Translational Science, and Nationwide Children's Hospital, and OSU Translational Data Analytics Institute.

Prior to joining OSU, I completed my PhD under the supervision of Mingyan Liu at the University of Michigan.




I am always looking for highly motivated students! Please see group page for details.
