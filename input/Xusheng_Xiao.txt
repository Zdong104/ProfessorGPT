Dr. Xusheng Xiao is leading the Reliable, Intelligent, Secure, and Efficient (RISE) Software and System lab at ASU. His general research interests span between software engineering and computer security, with the emphasis on AI-enhanced software and system analysis approaches that synergistically combine software analysis and artificial intelligence to improve the reliability and the security of software and computer systems. Specifically, his lab is working on the research in Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced software analysis, mobile app analysis, cyber threat detection and investigation, blockchain/smart contract security, and software testing and debugging. His research in cyber threat investigation has been integrated into a security product in NEC, which won the Grand Prix award at CEATEC Award 2016. His lab developed HyperService, the first interoperability blockchain platform with programmability and strong security guarantees, presented in IEEE Blockchain Cleveland and Blockland Solutions Conference. His research in mobile app security produced a static analysis technique that was deployed in Microsoft Research for two years and was granted a US patent. His collaboration with industry partners has resulted in 6 US patents.

Positions

I am always looking for PhD students and interns with strong background in SE, Security, or ML. Please apply to ASU SCAI by Dec. 31th (PhD only), and/or send me an email (with your CV). [Read more]
