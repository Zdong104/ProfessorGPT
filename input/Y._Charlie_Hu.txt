Y. Charlie Hu's research interests are in Mobile Systems, Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, and Computer Networks.

He is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and an IEEE Fellow. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harvard in 1997. He is a recipient of the Honda Initiation Grant Award, NSF CAREER Award, Purdue University College of Engineering Early Career Research Award, Purdue University Faculty Scholar, Purdue PRF Innovator Hall of Fame, and Purdue Engineering Most Impactful Faculty Inventors of 2019 and 2020. He has served as a General Co-Chair of ACM SIGCOMM 2014, and Program Committee Co-Chair of ACM MobiCom 2016, ACM SIGOPS EuroSys 2018, and IEEE ICNP 2021. Since 2010, his research group has conducted ground-breaking work on energy profiling and energy debugging on smartphones which has been widely covered by over 500 news media such as ABC News, NBC News, BBC, Times of India, MIT Tech Review, and Scientific American. Many of the technologies have been adopted by the mobile industry and are helping to extend the battery life of hundreds of millions of smartphones. His pioneering work on smartphone energy management has been recognized with ACM SIGOPS EuroSys 2012 Best Student Paper Award, ACM MobiCom 2022 Best Community Paper Award, 2022 ACM SIGOPS EuroSys Test-of-Time Papar Award, and 2023 ACM SIGMOBILE Test-of-Time Papar Award, as well as Industry awards including Google Research Award and Qualcomm Faculty Award.
