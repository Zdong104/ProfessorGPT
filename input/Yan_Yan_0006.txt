Brief Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning at School of Electrical Engineering And Computer Science, Washington State University, leading ROMA Lab. Before joining WSU, I was a postdoctoral research associate in Computer Science Department at University of Iowa, working with Professor Tianbao Yang. I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from Centre for Artificial Intelligent (CAI) in Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT), University of Technology Sydney, Australia (UTS), under the supervision of Professor Yi Yang. I was very fortunate to spend five years with people in ReLER Lab. In 2013, I received my B.E. from Tianjin University, in Computer Science.




Research Interests

Conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification
