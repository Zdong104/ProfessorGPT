Areas of Interest
Prof. Yanfang (Fanny) Ye’s main research interests are in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data mining, cybersecurity, and public health.

She has unique experience in both industry and academia. By harnessing large-scale, multi-source, multi-modality data, she and her group discover new research problems, tackle fundamental challenges in machine learning (especially graph learning and multimodal learning), and deploy their developed techniques into real-world applications with broader impacts. More specifically, she and her group strive to advance knowledge and science in graph learning and trustworthy multimodal learning, bridge AI/ML and cybersecurity concentrating on AI security, large-scale malware detection, and the study of the evolving underground ecosystem, and develop AI and data-driven techniques to combat the opioid crisis and infectious disease outbreaks. Besides the scholarly impact, she and her group’s works have generated significant industrial and societal impacts.

Integrating humanity and technology, her long-term goal of research is to advance capabilities and trustworthiness of AI to provide state-of-the-art innovations i) to secure cyberspace for its users, and ii) to improve health and well-being of people around the world.
