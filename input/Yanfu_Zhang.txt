I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the College of William and Mary. I have a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh. I studied at the University of Science and Technology of China, the University of Chinese Academy of Science, and the University of Rochester. My research interests include machine learning, data mining, and computer vision.

Multiple PhD Positions in Data Mining and Machine Learning at the College of William & Mary. The College of William & Mary (WM) is the second oldest university in the US. WM is one of only eight U.S. universities designated a “Public Ivy.” If you are interested in working with me, please submit this Googe form. Students from all backgrounds are welcome.

For William & Mary graduates: If you’re interested in collaborating with me, please don’t hesitate to send me an email. Kindly be aware that I usually prefer to engage in a working project before confirming my availability as a summer mentor. Direct requests are generally not accepted.
