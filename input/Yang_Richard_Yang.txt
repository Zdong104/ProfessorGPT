Basic info

Y. Richard Yang is a Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Yale, where he is a member of the Computer Systems Lab. His research spans areas including computer networks, wireless networking, mobile computing, distributed systems, and network security. His work with collaborators on the Internet has contributed to the establishment of the ALTO Internet Standard, which is the main Internet standard for networks and applications to interact, motivated by the P4P project that he led at Yale. His work on intradomain routing (e.g., COPE traffic engineering) and interdomain multi-domain backup (e.g., REIN) led to major Internet deployment. His work with collaborators on wireless networking has both advanced the physical layer (e.g., superposition coding) and made major influence on its architecture such as NEF and massive-MIMO, which are key features of modern celluar networks such as 5G. His work with collaborators on mobile computing has led to the establishment of a foundational theory of network localization based on rigitity theory, advancing both localization and mobility formation control. His work with collaborators on Sprite was among the first distributed mechanism design systems. His work has won best paper awards including ACM SIGMobile Test of Time Award, ACM SIGCOMM NAI Best Paper Award, IEEE IWQoS Best Paper, and ACM SIGCOMM best paper nominations (e.g., Maple) or fast track (e.g., selfish routing). His work is recognized by government awards including the National Science Foundation CAREER Award and industrial awards including Facebook Faculty Research Award, Google Faculty Research, and Microsoft Research Award. His work has been featured in media outlets including The Economist, Forbes, The Guardian, MIT Technology Review, and Wired, among others. He has served as program chairs on a wide range of topics including network quality of service (IEEE IWQoS), network economics (SIGCOMM NetEcon), programmable networking (SIGCOMM SOSR), and network-application integrations (SIGCOMM NAI). His research is supported by both government funding agencies (U.S. NSF, U.S. Army, and U.K. MoD) and leading corporations (Facebook, Google, and Microsoft). He received his B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University (1993), and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin (1998 and 2001). Although he joined Yale right after getting his PhD and still stays at Yale, he had held a number of visiting positions including EMC chaired professor group at Tsinghua University, visiting professor at Peking University, visiting reseacher at Microsoft Research, visiting researcher at CERN, and chief scientist of the Greater Bay Network. He served a number of volunteer positions including as the president of Chinese America Professors Association--Connecticut.

[July 26, 2022] A main pleasure is to work with the best people. Very impressed by the work by wonderful collaborators such as Jordi, Luis, Med, Roland, Qin, and Sabine. See slides for many related efforts.

Some proud results


Application-network integration (ALTO and P4P): My group's work on P4P (paper first appeared in SIGCOMM'08) is the foundation for the establishment of the IETF Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Working Group and related Internet standards. The base ALTO standard is defined by RFC7285: The ALTO Protocol. Citations see Google scholar link (890 citations as of Dec. 2019).

Network traffic engineering: My group conducted one of the most comprehensive studies of Internet traffic engineering, designing and implementing frameworks and systems including COPE (first paper appeared in a SIGCOMM'06 paper, citations see Google scholar link), ISP multihoming (first paper appeared in a SIGCOMM'04 paper, citations see Google scholar link), R3 (first paper appeared in a SIGCOMM'10 paper, citations see Google scholar link), Shadow Configuration, (first paper appeared in a SIGCOMM'08 paper, citations see Google scholar link), REIN (aka domain backup, first paper appeared in a SIGCOMM'07 paper, citations see Google scholar link), and selfish adaptive routing (first paper appeared in a SIGCOMM'03 paper, citations see Google scholar link).

Programmable networking: My group's work on the Maple network programming language (paper first appeared in SIGCOMM'13) is among the earliest high-level software-defined programming languages. Citations see Google scholar link.

Networking and economics: My group is among the first to design incentive compatible networking protocols. Our Sprite protocol (paper first appeared in INFOCOM'03). Citations of Sprite see Google scholar link (1634 citations as of Dec. 2019).

Mobile computing (localization): My group's work on network localization gives the first foundational theory of network localization (initial results in INFOCOM'04; complete theory in TMC'06). Citations of them see Google scholar (INFOCOM'04 Google scholar link, TMC'06 Google scholar link). (1200 total citations as of Dec. 2019).

Wireless (Massive MIMO): Our joint work on Argos (paper first appeared in Mobicom'12) is the first massive MIMO system, which is considered a foundation of 5G. Citations see Google scholar link (604 citations as of Dec. 2019).
