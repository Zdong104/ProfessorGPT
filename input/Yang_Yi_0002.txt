ShortBio

Yang (Cindy) Yi is a Professor in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and the Director of Multifunctional Integrated Circuits & Systems (MICS) at Virginia Tech (VT). In 2022, she has been selected as one of the 12 founding faculty of VT’s Innovation Campus. In 2019, she has been selected as a College of Engineering Faculty Fellow at VT. In the past 18 years, she has been working on various research topics in Integrated Circuits, Neuromorphic Computing, High Performance Computing and Communication at Texas A&M University, IBM, Freescale, Intel, Texas Instruments (TI), University of Missouri Kansas City, and University of Kansas (KU). She has more than 180 publications in international journals and conference proceedings and 8 of her paper have been selected as Best Paper Awards (Charles K. Kao Best Paper Award in 2020, IEEE Technical Committee on Green Communications & Computing Committee (TCGCC) in IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) in 2018, IEEE International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED) in 2018, and IEEE Transmission, Access, and Optical Systems Technical Committee (TAOS) in International Conference on Communications (ICC) in 2018, IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) in 2016, etc.)

Yang (Cindy) Yi’s research has been funded by National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense (DoD), National Spectrum Consortium (NSC), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFSOR), Amy Research Lab, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI), and many industrial companies (Micron, TEL, Intel, Samsung, QUALCOMM, TI, and NVidia). She has been involved in 33 external projects with a total funding exceeding $60 million projects with more than $7 million personal share of research funding.

Yang (Cindy) Yi has been serving as the Book Editor, General Chair, Program Chair, Technical Program Committee (TPC) Track Chair and TPC member in various international conferences, and Editorial Board Members for several international journals. She received multiple awards for her research, teaching and service: VT Dean’s Award for Excellent in Research in 2024, MICRON & TEL UPWARDS Faculty, VT Research Excellence (Major Sponsored Proposal) Award, Virginia Tech Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Fellow, IEEE Featured Author in 2023; Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science (ICTAS) Junior Faculty Award, COE Faculty Fellow in 2019; National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award in 2018; United States Air Force (USAF) Summer Faculty Fellowship, KU Miller Professional Development Award for Distinguished Research in 2016; NSF EPSCoR First Award, USAF Summer Faculty Fellowship, KU Miller Scholar Award in 2015; KU New Faculty General Research Award, Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Visiting Faculty Research Fellowship in 2014.
