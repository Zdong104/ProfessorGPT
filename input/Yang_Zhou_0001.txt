I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the Auburn University. Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. degree in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

My current research interests lie in several reasearch areas, including Trustworthy Machine Learning, Parallel, Distributed, and Federated Learning, Natural Language Processing, Graph Machine Learning. Our lab has built close collaborative relationships with Microsoft, Amazon, and Sony Research. Our research contributions have been published in top venues of machine learning (ICML, NeurIPS), artificial intelligence (AAAI, IJCAI, TIST), natural language processing (ACL, EMNLP), data mining (KDD, ICDM, SDM, TKDD, DMKD, KAIS), high performance computing (HPDC, SC, TPDS), database systems (VLDB, ICDE, CIKM, TKDE, VLDBJ), Web (WWW, TWEB), and networking (JSAC, TOIT).

Currently, there are several fully funded Ph.D. positions available in deep learning, trustworthy machine learning, federated learning, or natural language processing. In addition, our industrial collaborators are hiring multiple summer interns in the above research fields. Interested students are encouraged to email me your CVs and transcripts.
