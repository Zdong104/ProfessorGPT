WHO IS YANGMING?
ABOUT

Yangming Lee is an assistant professor at Rochester Institute of Technology. Before this appointment, he held the positions as an acting instructor at Biorobotics Lab., University of Washington, and associate/assistant professor at Institute of Intelligent Machines, CAS, where he luckily received the Young Investigator Award from National Science Foundation of China. He also worked at the APRIL lab., where he was the team member of the champion team, “Team Michigan”, in Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge (MAGIC2010).

Yangming is passionated in robotics. He is particularly interested in improving performance and reliability of environmental perception and modeling, robot manipulator collaboration, and manipulator and environment interaction, through probabilistic methods and learning techniques.

RESEARCH
RESEARCH

Yangming's research focuses on applying probabilistic methods and learning techniques on mobile manipulator collaborative autonomy and supervised robotic surgical autonomy.

MOBILE MANIPULATORS COLLABORATIVE AUTONOMY

Collaborative Perception.

Cooperative Motion Planning.

SURGICAL ROBOT SUPERVISED AUTONOMY
I have openings for:
strongly self-motivated Ph.D. students and visiting students or scholars, who are interested in collaborative robotic perception, control, and learning.
Immediate two opening for research assistant positions in 1) mobile robot cooperative perception, 2) surgical motion analysis and learning.

Please email your CV and cover letter to yangming.li at rit.edu for more information.
