I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science Department and Data Science Program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I am also an affiliated researcher at UMass Transportation Center (UMTC). I obtained two Ph.D. degrees, in Computer Science from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2013, and Electrical Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2009, respectively. I am interested in artificial intelligence and spatial-temporal data science with applications in smart cities and urban intelligence. I am a senior member of IEEE and a member of ACM and AAAI.

Openings I am looking for self-motivated PhD students and visiting scholars to work with me on the exciting area of urban intelligence. I'm particularly interested in candidates with background in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Statistics, Applied Math, and strong programming skill. Please send me a short email with your C.V. and anything you believe relevant! For PhD program applicants, here is the admission page at WPI.
