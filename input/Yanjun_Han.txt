Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Data Science,
Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Center for Data Science, and Computer Science Department (affiliated),
New York University

I received my B.E. in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in Jul 2015, and my M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in Aug 2021, under the supervision of Tsachy Weissman. I was a postdoctoral scholar at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, University of California, Berkeley in 2021-22, and a Norbert Wiener postdoctoral associate at the Statistics and Data Science Center (SDSC) in MIT IDSS in 2022-23.

I am broadly interested in the mathematics of data science, including statistics, learning theory, bandits, and information theory.

Due to the large volume of emails that I receive, I generally do not respond to unsolicited inquiries about student or postdoc openings; please apply through Courant or CDS programs. Nevertheless, if you have a strong quantitative background and think your interests are compatible with mine, please feel free to contact me.
