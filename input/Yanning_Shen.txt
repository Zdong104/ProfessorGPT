My research interests span the areas of machine learning, network science, data science, optimization, and statistical signal processing; along with their applications in social, brain, gene-regulatory, environmental, financial, and IoT systems.

I am looking for self-motivated undergrad and grad students. For students at UCI, please contact me and include your research interest, CV, transcripts, as well as writing samples (if any) in your email. For prospective graduate students, please apply to UCI ECE or Network Systems and mention my name in your application.
