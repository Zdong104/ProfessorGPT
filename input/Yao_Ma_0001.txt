Short Bio

Yao Ma is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Before joining RPI, he worked as an Assistant Professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology.
He got his PhD from Michigan State University in 2021 under the supervision of Dr. Jiliang Tang. Before that, he completed his MS (2016) in Statistics, Probability & Operations Research at Eindhoven University of Technology and BS (2015) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Zhejiang University.


I have several fully-funded PhD positions available in Fall 2024 and Spring 2025. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to email me. Please check here for more details.
