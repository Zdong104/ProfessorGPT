Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of statistics, optimization, and machine learning. I work on developing computationally efficient and statistically powerful algorithms with guarantees, for engineering problems arising from various real-world applications.

I am particularly interested in sequential data analysis and change-point detection, and their applications in sensor networks, social networks, imaging and communications.

For recent publications and preprints, please see here. My Erdős number is 3.

My work has generated societal and policy impact: see here for our work on data-driven policing.

Articles by GT about my research "In pursuit of better data forecasting." and "Driving data science innovation as Coca-Cola Foundation Chair."

I am humbled and honored to receive the prestigious INFORMS Donald P. Gaver, Jr. Early Career Award for Excellence in Operations Research in 2022, which is awarded to one recipient across INFORMS annually. Citation: "For outstanding research contributions at the interface of operations research, statistics, machine learning and optimization; for successfully applying her research talent to applications of societal importance; and for contributions to the education and mentoring of students at all levels." Here is my acceptance speech and picture at INFORMS Award Ceremony, Oct. 2022 with (a subset) of my (current and former) students.
