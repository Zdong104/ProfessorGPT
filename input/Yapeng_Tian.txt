Bio

I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of UT Dallas and lead the Computer Vision and Multimodal Computing (CVMC) Lab. I am interested in solving core computer vision, computer audition, and machine learning problems and applying the developed learning approaches to broad AI applications.

Before coming to UTD, I finished my PhD at University of Rochester, advised by Chenliang Xu, my master degree at Tsinghua University working with Wenming Yang, and B.E degree at Xidian University. I was a visiting student at SIAT advised by Yu Qiao. I did internships at Adobe Research with Dingzeyu Li and Meta with Alexander Richard.
