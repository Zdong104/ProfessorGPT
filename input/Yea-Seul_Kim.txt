Enabling Tabular Data Exploration for Blind and Low-Vision Users
Yanan Wang, Arjun Srinivasan, Yea-Seul Kim
In a data-driven society, being able to examine data on one’s own terms is crucial for various aspects of well-being. However, current data exploration paradigms, such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), heavily rely on visualizations to unveil patterns and insights. This visual-centric approach poses significant challenges for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To address this gap, we built a prototype that supports non-visual data exploration and conducted an observational user study involving 18 BLV participants. Read More

How Do Low-Vision Individuals Experience Information Visualization?
Yanan Wang, Yuhang Zhao, Yea-Seul Kim
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in enhancing the accessibility of visualizations for people with visual impairments. While much of the research has focused on improving accessibility for screen reader users, the specific needs of people with remaining vision (i.e., low-vision individuals) have been largely unaddressed. To bridge this gap, we conducted a qualitative study that provides insights into how low-vision individuals experience visualizations. Read More

Erie: A Declarative Grammar for Data Sonification
Hyeok Kim, Yea-Seul Kim, Jessica Hullman
Data sonification—mapping data variables to auditory variables, such as pitch or volume—is used for data accessibility, scientific exploration, and data-driven art (e.g., museum exhibitions) among others. While a substantial amount of research has been made on effective and intuitive sonification design, software support is not commensurate, limiting researchers from fully exploring its capabilities. We contribute Erie, a declarative grammar for data sonification, that enables abstractly expressing auditory mappings. Erie supports specifying extensible tone designs (e.g., periodic wave, sampling, frequency/amplitude modulation synthesizers), various encoding channels, auditory legends, and composition options like sequencing and overlaying.

Making Data-Driven Articles More Accessible: An Active Preference Learning Approach to Data Fact Personalization
Yanan Wang, Yea-Seul Kim
Data-driven news articles are widely used to communicate societal phenomena with concrete evidence. These articles are often accompanied by a visualization, helping readers to contextualize content. However, blind and low vision (BLV) individuals have limited access to visualizations, hindering a deep understanding of data. We explore the possibility of dynamically generating data facts (texts describing data patterns in a chart) for BLV individuals based on their preferences to aid the reading of such articles.

Explain What a Treemap is: Exploratory Investigation of Strategies for Explaining Unfamiliar Chart to Blind and Low Vision Users
Gyeongri Kim, Jiho Kim, Yea-Seul Kim
Visualization designers increasingly use diverse types of visualizations, but assistive technologies and education for blind and low vision people often focus on elementary chart types. We explore textual explanation as a more generalizable solution. We define three dimensions of explanation strategies based on education theories: comparing to a familiar chart type, describing how to draw one, and using a concrete example. We develop a prototype system that automatically generates text explanations from a given chart specification. Read More

Exploring Chart Question Answering for Blind and Low Vision Users
Jiho Kim, Arjun Srinivasan, Nam Wook Kim, Yea-Seul Kim
Data visualizations can be complex or involve numerous data points, making them impractical to navigate using screen readers alone. Question answering (QA) systems have the potential to support visualization interpretation and exploration without overwhelming blind and low vision (BLV) users. To investigate if and how QA systems can help BLV users in working with visualizations, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study with 24 BLV people where participants freely posed queries about four visualizations.

VisLab: Enabling Visualization Designers to Gather Empirically Informed Design Feedback
Jinhan Choi, Changhoon Oh, Yea-Seul Kim, Nam Wook Kim
When creating a visualization, designers face various conflicting design choices. They typically rely on their hunches to deal with intricate trade-offs or resort to feedback from their colleagues. On the other hand, researchers have long used empirical methods to derive useful quantitative insights into visualization designs. Taking inspiration from this research tradition, we developed VisLab, an open-source online system to complement the existing qualitative feedback practice and help visualization practitioners run experiments to gather empirically informed design feedback.

Thirty-Two Years of IEEE VIS: Authors, Fields of Study and Citations
Hongtao Hao, Yumian Cui, Zhengxiang Wang, Yea-Seul Kim
The IEEE VIS Conference (VIS) recently rebranded itself as a unified conference and officially positioned itself within the discipline of Data Science. Driven by this movement, we investigated (1) who contributed to VIS, and (2) where VIS stands in the scientific world. We examined the authors and fields of study of 3,240 VIS publications in the past 32 years based on data collected from OpenAlex and IEEE Xplore, among other sources. We also examined the citation flows from referenced papers (i.e., those referenced in VIS) to VIS, and from VIS to citing papers (i.e., those citing VIS). We found that VIS has been becoming increasingly popular and collaborative. Read More

Seeing What You Believe or Believing What You See? Belief Biases Correlation Estimation
Cindy Xiong, Chase Stokes, Yea-Seul Kim, Steven Franconeri
When an analyst or scientist has a belief about how the world works, their thinking can be biased in favor of that belief. Therefore, one bedrock principle of science is to minimize that bias by testing the predictions of one’s belief against objective data. But interpreting visualized data is a complex perceptual and cognitive process. Through two crowdsourced experiments, we demonstrate that supposedly objective assessments of the strength of a correlational relationship can be influenced by how strongly a viewer believes in the existence of that relationship.

Seeing Through Sounds: Mapping Auditory Dimensions to Data and Charts for People with Visual Impairments
Ruobin Wang, Crescentia Jung, Yea-Seul Kim
Sonification can be an effective medium for people with visual impairments to understand data in visualizations. However, there are no universal design principles that apply to various charts that encode different data types. Towards generalizable principles, we conducted an exploratory experiment to assess how different auditory channels (e.g., pitch, volume) impact the data and visualization perception among people with visual impairments.

VIBE: A Design Space for VIsual Belief Elicitation in Data Journalism
Shambhavi Mahajan, Alireza Karduni, Bonnie Chen, Yea-Seul Kim, Emily Wall
The process of forming, expressing, and updating beliefs from data plays a critical role in data-driven decision making. Effectively eliciting those beliefs has potential for high impact across a broad set of applications, including increased engagement with data and visualizations, personalizing visualizations, and understanding users' visual reasoning processes, which can inform improved data analysis and decision making strategies (e.g., via bias mitigation).

What makes web data tables accessible? Insights and a tool for rendering accessible tables for people with visual impairments
Yanan Wang, Ruobin Wang, Crescentia Jung, Yea-Seul Kim
The data table is a basic but versatile representation to communicate data. From government reports to bank statements, tables efectively carry essential data-driven information by visually organizing data using rows, columns, and other arrangements (e.g., merged cells). However, many tables online neglect the accessibility requirements for people who rely on screen readers, such as people who are blind or have low vision (BLV). Read More

Putting scientific results in perspective: Improving the communication of standardized effect sizes
Yea-Seul Kim, Jake Hofman, Daniel Goldstein
How do people form impressions of efect size when reading scientifc results? We present a series of studies on how people perceive treatment efectiveness when scientifc results are summarized in various ways. We frst show that a prevalent form of summarizing results presenting mean diferences between conditions can lead to signifcant overestimation of treatment efectiveness, and that including confdence intervals can exacerbate the problem.

Accessible Visualization: Design Space, Opportunities, and Challenges
Nam Wook Kim, Shakila Joyner, Amalia Riegelhuth, Yea-Seul Kim
Visualizations are now widely used across disciplines to understand and communicate data. The benefit of visualizations lies in leveraging our natural visual perception. However, the sole dependency on vision can produce unintended discrimination against people with visual impairments. While the visualization field has seen enormous growth in recent years, supporting people with disabilities is much less explored. In this work, we examine approaches to support this marginalized user group, focusing on visual disabilities. We collected and analyzed papers published for the last 20 years on visualization accessibility. Read More

Bayesian-Assisted Inference from Visualized Data
Yea-Seul Kim, Paula Kayongo, Madeleine Grunde-McLaughlin, Jessica Hullman
A Bayesian view of data interpretation suggests that a visualization user should update their existing beliefs about a parameter's value in accordance with the amount of information about the parameter value captured by the new observations. Extending recent work applying Bayesian models to understand and evaluate belief updating from visualizations, we show how the predictions of Bayesian inference can be used to guide more rational belief updating. We design a Bayesian inference-assisted uncertainty analogy that numerically relates uncertainty in observed data to the user's subjective uncertainty, and a posterior visualization that prescribes how a user should update their beliefs given their prior beliefs and the observed data.

Inking Your Insights: Investigating Digital Externalization Behaviors During Data Analysis
Yea-Seul Kim, Nathalie Henry Riche, Bongshin Lee, Matthew Brehmer, Michel Pahud, Ken Hinckley, Jessica Hullman
Externalizing one's thoughts can be helpful during data analysis, such as which one marks interesting data, notes hypotheses, and draws diagrams. In this paper, we present two exploratory studies conducted to investigate types and use of externalizations during the analysis process. We first studied how people take notes during different stages of data analysis using VoyagerNote, a visualization recommendation system augmented to support text annotations, and coupled with participants' favorite external note-taking tools (e.g., word processor, pen & paper). Externalizations manifested mostly as notes written on paper or in a word processor, with annotations atop views used almost exclusively in the initial phase of analysis. Read More

Vocal Shortcuts for Creative Experts
Yea-Seul Kim, Mira Dontcheva, Eytan Adar, Jessica Hullman
Vocal shortcuts, short spoken phrases to control interfaces, have the potential to reduce cognitive and physical costs of interactions. They may benefit expert users of creative applications (e.g., designers, illustrators) by helping them maintain creative focus. To aid the design of vocal shortcuts and gather use cases and design guidelines for speech interaction, we interviewed ten creative experts. Read More

Improving Comprehension of Measurements Using Concrete Re-expression Strategies
Jessica Hullman, Yea-Seul Kim, Francis Nguyen, Lauren Speers, Maneesh Agrawala
It can be difficult to understand physical measurements (e.g., 28 lb, 600 gallons) that appear in news stories, data reports, and other documents. We develop tools that automatically re-express unfamiliar measurements using the measurements of familiar objects. Our work makes three contributions: (1) we identify effectiveness criteria for objects used in concrete measurement re-expressions; (2) we operationalize these criteria in a scalable method for mining a large dataset of concrete familiar objects with their physical dimensions from Amazon and Wikipedia; and (3) we develop automated concrete reexpression tools that implement three common re-expression strategies (adding familiar context, reunitization and proportional analogy) as energy minimization algorithms.

Data Through Others' Eyes: The Impact of Visualizing Others' Expectations on Visualization Interpretation
Yea-Seul Kim, Katharina Reinecke, Jessica Hullman
In addition to visualizing input data, interactive visualizations have the potential to be social artifacts that reveal other people's perspectives on the data. However, how such social information embedded in a visualization impacts a viewer's interpretation of the data remains unknown. Inspired by recent interactive visualizations that display people's expectations of data against the data, we conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate the effect of showing social information in the form of other people's expectations on people's ability to recall the data, the degree to which they adjust their expectations to align with the data, and their trust in the accuracy of the data.

Imagining Replications: Graphical Prediction & Discrete Visualizations Improve Recall & Estimation of Effect Uncertainty
Jessica Hullman, Matthew Kay, Yea-Seul Kim, Samana Shrestha
People often have erroneous intuitions about the results of uncertain processes, such as scientific experiments. Many uncertainty visualizations assume considerable statistical knowledge, but have been shown to prompt erroneous conclusions even when users possess this knowledge. Active learning approaches as well as discrete (frequency) formats for probability information have been shown to improve statistical reasoning, but are rarely applied in visualizing uncertainty in scientific reports. We present a controlled study to evaluate the impact of an alternative, interactive graphical prediction technique for communicating uncertainty in experiment results. Read More

Generating Personalized Spatial Analogies for Distances and Areas
Yea-Seul Kim, Jessica Hullman, Maneesh Agrawala
Distances and areas frequently appear in text articles. However, people struggle to understand these measurements when they cannot relate them to measurements of locations that they are personally familiar with. We contribute tools for generating personalized spatial analogies: re-expressions that contextualize spatial measurements in terms of locations with similar measurements that are more familiar to the user.

Users' Music Information Needs and Behaviors: Design Implications for Music Information Retrieval Systems
Jin Ha Lee, Hyerim Cho, Yea-Seul Kim
User studies in the music information retrieval (MIR) domain tend to be exploratory and qualitative in nature, involving a small number of users, which makes it difficult to derive broader implications for system design. In order to fill this gap, we conducted a large-scale user survey questioning various aspects of people's music information needs and behaviors. In particular, we investigate if general music users' needs and behaviors have significantly changed over time by comparing our current survey result with a similar survey conducted in 2004.

DeScipher: A Text Simplification Tool for Science Journalism
Yea-Seul Kim, Jessica Hullman, Eytan Adar
Complex jargon often makes scientific work less accessible to the general public. By employing a set of specific reporting strategies, journalists bridge these groups by delivering information about scientific advances in a readable, engaging way. One such strategy is using simpler terms in place of complex jargon. To assist in this process, we introduce DeScipher, a text editor application that suggests and ranks possible simplifications of complex terminology to a journalist while she is authoring an article.
