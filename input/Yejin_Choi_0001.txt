Research Interests:
My primary research interests are in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, with broader interests in Computer Vision and Digital Humanities.

Language and X ∈ {vision, knowledge, world, mind, society...} : Intelligent communication requires the ability to read between the lines and to reason beyond what is said explicitly. My recent research has been under two broad themes: (i) learning the contextual, grounded meaning of language from various contexts in which language is used — both physical (e.g., visual) and abstract (e.g., social, cognitive), and (ii) learning the background knowledge about how the world works, latent in large-scale multimodal data. More specifically, my research interests include:


Language Grounding with Vision: Learning semantic correspondences between language and vision at a very large scale, addressing tasks such as image captioning, multimodal knowledge learning, and reasoning.
Physical Commonsense Reasoning: Learning naive physics type knowledge from language and other modalities; modeling action causality and entailment using frame semantic style representation.
Social Commonsense Reasoning and Connotation Frames: Modeling connotative implications of actions and events; modeling why people do (intent) what they do and the (emotional) causal impact of different actions and events.
Language Generation and Conversational AI: Modeling the long-term context; tracking and simulating the world representend in a story or a narrative; learning to write; integrating physical and social commonsense in storytelling
AI for Social Good: fake review / news detection; political factchecking; identifying unwanted bias in modern films and literature
