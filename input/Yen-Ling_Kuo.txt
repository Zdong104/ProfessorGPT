Thank you for visiting Yen-Ling's website!

I recently joined the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia as an Assistant Professor.

Before joining UVA, I did my PhD at MIT CSAIL advised by Dr. Boris Katz and Dr. Andrei Barbu. My research focuses on enabling generalizations in human-AI/robot interactions – building robots that can generalize their learned models to robustly interact with humans in novel scenarios. Toward this vision, I develop machine learning models that provide robots with generalizable reasoning skills including language understanding and social interactions. You can find my papers on the publication page.

I'm looking for motivated students to join my group at UVA CS!

I will be glad to discuss research with you or hear any feedback you have. Please kindly send me an e-mail to ylkuo@virginia.edu.
