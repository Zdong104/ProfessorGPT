Yi He
Ph.D.
I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at Old Dominion University, during Fall 2021 to Spring 2024. I received my Ph.D from the Center for Advanced Computer Studies (CACS) at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2020, advised by Dr. Xindong Wu. Before that, I received the B.E. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), China, in 2013. My research interests lie broadly in data mining, machine learning, and optimization theory and specifically in online learning, real-time data analytics, representation learning, graph mining, recommender systems, and explainable AI. I am a recipient of the IEEE TCII Volunteer Award 2022 and the NSF CRII Award 2023. This webpage has stopped to be updated since my relocation to William & Mary in 2024.

News
[07/2023] Honored to receive the NSF CORE collaborative research as the Lead PI (ODU link, FAU link). Kudos to Drs. Xingquan Zhu, Hongyi Wu, and Laurent Cherubin for the unwavering support, expertise, and dedication that have made this happen. A huge thanks to NSF for the trust and support on the open-world streaming graph learning research!
[06/2023] Thrilled and humbled to receive the NSF CRII award (link). Many thanks to NSF for the trust, confidence, and support on the real-time data mining research!
[06/2023] One paper gets accepted by ECML-PKDD'23 (199/830 = 24%).
[05/2023] I will serve on the NSF CISE panel.
[04/2023] Our survey gets accepted by IJCAI'23 (survey track: 34/148 = 23%). We aim to construct a comprehensive chronicles of online learning algorithms in open feature spaces, envisioning exciting future trajectories in this vibrant research field.
[04/2023] Delighted to receive the SRFP award. Thanks to ODU for the support!
[03/2023] One paper gets accepted by IEEE Transactions on Services Computing . Congrats to Yujia -- excellent work done by an MS student!
[01/2023] Delighted to receive the CCI grant as PI (media). Thanks to COVA CCI for the support!
