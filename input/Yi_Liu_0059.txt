Short Bio

I am an Assistant Professor of Data Science with the Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics and the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University. Before that, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Florida State University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Texas A&M University in 2022, advised by Dr. Shuiwang Ji. I received my M.E. in Biomedical Engineering in 2015 and B.E. in Electronic Engineering in 2012, both from University of Science and Technology of China.

Research Interests

I am broadly interested in machine learning, deep learning, and data mining. My current and specific research interests are geometric deep learning , AI for Science (AI4Science), and LLMs for Science. I strive to develop novel AI methods to solve important problems in sciences, including but not limited to quantum chemistry, material science, biochemistry, physics, and PDEs.

Besides publishing top-tier papers, I am also active in open challenges and open-source communities. I am leading the champion team on Cleft Detection of MICCAI CREMI Open Challenge, a member of the #3 team on the Open Catalyst Challenge, and a contributor to the popular open-source library DIG:Dive Into Graphs.

[Prospective students] I am looking for highly motivated and self-driven Ph.D. students with strong mathematical backgrounds and/or programming skills. You can apply to any of the Ph.D. programs in Computer Science, Data Science, and Applied Mathematics & Statistics, and mention me in your applications. If you are sending an email, please start your email subject with "PhD Application-Semester-Year". Your email should include your CV and ALL transcripts. Your CV should include your (1) undergraduate GPA and ranking (if applicable), and (2) TOEFL score (GRE is NOT required). You can rest assured that all E-mails will be read, but please accept apologies if you do not receive a response. Please do NOT send repeated inquiries, which would not help.

For current students at Stony Brook, please send me an email with your CV for an in-person meeting. Note currently I don't provide RA support for master students. I also host self-funded interns and visiting students/scholars. For applicants outside the US, only the remote option is available. Please drop me an email if you are willing to work on an exciting project on AI4Science and LLMs for Science!
