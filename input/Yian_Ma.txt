Yian Ma
I am an assistant professor at the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and an affliated faculty member at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of University of California San Diego.
Prior to UCSD, I spent a year as a visiting faculty at Google Research. Before that, I was a post-doctoral fellow at EECS, UC Berkeley. I completed my Ph.D. at University of Washington and obtained my bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
My current research primarily revolves around scalable inference methods for credible machine learning. This involves designing Bayesian inference methods to quantify uncertainty in the predictions of complex models; understanding computational and statistical guarantees of inference algorithms; and leveraging these scalable algorithms to learn from time series data and perform sequential decision making tasks.
