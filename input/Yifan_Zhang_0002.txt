About me

I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at the Binghamton University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the College of William and Mary, and B.S. in Computer Science from Beihang University. I spent several years in industry as a system software engineer before joining academia.

My research interests are generally in the areas of mobile computing systems, operating systems, embedded systems and wireless networks. Within these areas, I am especially interested in building system supports for emerging computing paradigms, such as edge/cloud computing, mobile/IoT applications, and distributed machine learning systems. Please check my recent papers below for more details.

I am looking for motivated students to work with me in the above research areas/directions. If you are interested and are good at programming, please send me an email, or stop by and let's chat.
