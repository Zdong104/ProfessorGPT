Welcome to the EIC lab website at Georgia Tech!

The EIC lab in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech focuses on developing efficient machine learning (ML) techniques via cross-layer innovations, spanning from artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to AI hardware accelerators and AI chip design, and aims to foster green AI and ubiquitous AI-powered intelligence.



We are always looking for self-motivated and creative students who are passionate about exploring techniques to develop energy/time-efficient intelligent systems. Please check out our research page and publications to learn more about our research focus and recent works.
