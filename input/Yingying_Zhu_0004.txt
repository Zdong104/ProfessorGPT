I am working in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Texas at Arlington as an assistant professor and also a guest researcher working in clinical center, NIH. I was a Staff Scientist working with Ronald M. Summers at Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health. I work on the intersection of computer vision, medical image analysis, bioinformatics and machine learning with the goal of developing machine learning tools for solving real-world problems. I am currently looking for PhD student to working on machine learning, computer vision and medical data analysis. Details can be found here. contact: yingying.zhu@uta.edu


I did a postdoc at Cornell University working with Mert Sabuncu and postdoc in UNC Chapel Hill working with Guorong Wu. I obtained my Ph.D. from University of Queensland, Australia under the supervision of Simon Lucey (currently research associate professor in CMU, Pittsburgh, USA).
