About Me
I am an associate professor of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Before Madison, I was a postdoc at Princeton and had the pleasure to work with Sanjeev Arora. I received my Ph.D. in 2014 from Georgia Tech, where I was fortunate to be advised by Nina Balcan and also work closely with Le Song. I received my M.S. (2010) and B.S. (2008) from Tsinghua University under the great guidance of Jianmin Li and Bo Zhang. I'm a recipient of the NSF CAREER award.
