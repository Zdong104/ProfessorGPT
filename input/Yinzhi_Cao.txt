Bio

My research mainly focuses on the security and privacy of the Web, smartphones, and machine learning using program analysis techniques. My past work was widely featured by over 30 media outlets, such as NSF Science Now (Episode 38), CCTV News, IEEE Spectrum, Yahoo! News and ScienceDaily. My work on JavaScript analysis discovered many zero-day vulnerabilities (including over 80 CVEs) in over 2,500 real-world websites (e.g., those in the Top 100) and real-world NPM packages. I received multiple Distinguished Paper Awards at CCS'23, USENIX'22, SOSP’17 and IEEE CNS’15 respectively and a best paper nomination at CCS’20. I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award 2021, DARPA Young Faculty Award (YFA) 2022, Johns Hopkins Catalyst Award 2023, and Amazon Research Award (2021, 2017).
