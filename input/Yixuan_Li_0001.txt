Human values encompass far more than "helpfulness" and "harmlessness". They span broad personality traits, political views, moral beliefs, and beyond. Can we elicit diverse personas encoded in LLMs?

Alignment techniques are crucial for large language models like GPT, Llama, etc. Yet, the theoretical understanding of alignment is still in its infancy. @shawnim00's recent work, accepted by #ICML2024, takes an exciting step in this direction. Here, I reflect on our recentâ€¦ https://t.co/DscGJNEm5M

About


I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I am a member of machine learning@uw-madison and a faculty affiliate with the Data Science Institute. Previously I was as a postdoc researcher in the Computer Science department at Stanford University, working with the Hazy Group. I completed my PhD from Cornell University in 2017, where I was fortunate to be advised by John E. Hopcroft.


My passion and dream are to advance AI systems to a stage where they are not only intelligent but also safe and beneficial for humanity. Specifically, my lab focuses on algorithmic and theoretical foundations of reliable machine learning, addressing challenges in both model development and deployment in the open world. This involves detecting out-of-distribution data and learning novel structures and categories therein. Currently, our emphasis is on building responsible foundation models, such as large language models and vision-language models. We are driven to deeply understand how they work, when they fail, and effectively align them with human needs and desires.




[Openings]: I am looking for creative and curiosity-driven minds to join my lab, with fully funded positions. The admission decision at UW-Madison is committee-based. For questions regarding the application process, please see the FAQ. I highly recommend reading my [Advising Statement] before you apply or email me.
