I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on Code Large Language Models and AI Security. My recent papers are on Google scholar.

Previously, I was a postdoc at UC Berkeley and Columbia University. I received the PhD in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology. I received the BS degree in Information Security from Fudan University, Shanghai, China. During my time as an undergrad, I was an exchange student in University of California, Santa Barbara.

I am looking for PhD students. If you are interested in working with me, please fill out the questionnaire, and send me an email: yzchen [at] umd [dot] edu.

NEWS
I will give a guest lecture on "Securing AI Coding Assistants" at the Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School in Computer Science (CMMRS 2024).
Our benchmark PrimeVul was used by Gemini 1.5 Pro for vulnerability detection evaluation.
DiverseVul update: metadata and label noise analysis release.
I will teach CMSC818I: Advanced Topics in Computer Systems; Large Language Models, Security, and Privacy in Fall 2024. Here is the previous edition of this class.
