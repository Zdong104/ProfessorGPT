About Me [ CV ]

I am currently an associate professor at Computer Science, UCLA. Prior to that, I joined Northeastern University as an assistant professor in 2013. I received my Ph.D. degree from Computer Science Department,  University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) in December 2012. I got my master degree and bachelor degrees in Computer Science and Statistics from Peking University, China.
