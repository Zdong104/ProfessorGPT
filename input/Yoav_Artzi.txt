I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Cornell Tech at Cornell University, arXiv's associate faculty director, and a researcher at ASAPP. I hold a B.Sc. from Tel Aviv University and a Ph.D. from the University of Washington, where I was advised by Luke Zettlemoyer.

I study natural language acquisition, modeling, and use through a computational perspective, with focus on automated, situated systems. My research goals are: (a) to build computer systems that interact with users using natural language and continually improve through interaction, and (b) to develop computational understanding of natural language as a communication system. A core principle underlying my current work is that learning, production, and comprehension of natural language does not occur in isolation, but within dynamic interactions with other intentional adaptive agents situated in a shared environment. My group's research is anchored in natural language processing and machine learning, and often reaches out to robotics, computer vision, and cognitive science. Core to our methodology is driving algorithm development by building and deploying complete interactive systems. Our work has been recognized by an NSF CAREER award, as well as acknowledged by paper awards, honorable mentions, and spotlight presentations at ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, NeurIPS, and IROS.

I post paper recommendations at  RecNet (our paper recommendation network) and occasionally (b)log.
