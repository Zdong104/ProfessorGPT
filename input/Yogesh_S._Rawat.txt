Research
Our lab studies computer vision, multimedia, and deep learning. We mainly explore the video domain with focus on activity recognition and robust video understanding. We also study the role of multiple modalities in computer vision and how different modalities can be utilized for robust video understanding. Another prime focus of the lab is to utilize large-scale unlabelled datasets with label efficient learning. Other interests include, video synthesis, bio-metrics, and robust video representation learning.

I am looking for a PostDoc for our group, please reach out if you are interested. I am always looking for PhD candidates, please reach out with your resume if you are interested in working with our group.
