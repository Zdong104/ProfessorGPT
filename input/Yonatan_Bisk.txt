My research is in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a focus on grounding and embodiment. Language is the abstract social codification of our world and experiences. So, I'm interested in where meaning comes from, and connecting language to perception and control.

Visitors/Students:
Summer/Fall 2024: Visitors, interns, or new students? No... sorry. I will update this after fall matching.
Spring/Fall 2025: Very likely, but that's so far in the future :)

Travel: Where is Yonatan? I have a yearly travel budget so I don't attend that many conferences, sorry. I'll try and keep this sorta updated.
