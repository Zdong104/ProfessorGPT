Bio / CV / Research Statement / Github / Google Scholar


I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Sciences Department at UW-Madison.  My research interests are in computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on creating robust visual recognition systems that can learn to understand the visual world with minimal human supervision.  Before joining UW-Madison in Fall 2021, I spent one year as an AI Visiting Faculty at Cruise, and before that, 6 wonderful years as an Assistant and then Associate Professor at UC Davis.  Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the EECS Dept at UC Berkeley working with Alyosha Efros (8/2013-6/2014).  I also spent a year as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (8/2012-8/2013), where I had the good fortune to work with Alyosha Efros and Martial Hebert.  I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2012 under the supervision of Kristen Grauman, and my B.S. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2006.  I have also worked with Larry Zitnick and Michael Cohen as a summer intern at Microsoft Research.


Prospective PhD students: please apply to the UW-Madison Computer Sciences program if you'd like to work with me. Unfortunately, I may not be able to respond to individual emails about admissions.
