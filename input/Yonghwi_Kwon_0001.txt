Great Reads

Two excellent suggestions for Ph.D. students by Matt Might:
1. 10 easy ways to fail a Ph.D.
2. 3 qualities of successful Ph.D. students: Perseverance, tenacity and cogency

From the Advice for researchers and students compiled by Michael Ernst:
1. Writing a progress/status report
2. How to write a technical paper

There are some great and fun (and also educational) TED talks you can watch when you are bored:
1. Grit: the power of passion and perseverance (Grit is very important for being a good researcher)
2. Inside the mind of a master procrastinator (Let's not be a procrastinator)
3. How to speak so that people want to listen
4. This is what happens when you reply to spam email

There are some ways to systematically generate good ideas:
1. TRIZ is "theory of the resolution of invention-related tasks"





Technical Articles and Books

I authored a book named Effective Windows Programming which covers various advanced techniques and tricks for Windows Programming (Win32 APIs).
I also enjoy coding and writing technical articles. Here are some of my articles explaining details about coding, debugging, and reverse-engineering.

1. Hooking the Real COM Objects: Intercepting IHTMLDocument3 Functions, Dec 2011
2. Phishing applications: Security threats regarding the SetParent function, Nov 2011
