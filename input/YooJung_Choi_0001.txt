About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. My research interests are in probabilistic reasoning and learning (tractable probabilistic models, graphical models, knowledge compilation) and trustworthy AI/ML (robustness, fairness, explainability, and more).

Before joining ASU, I received my PhD from the Computer Science department at UCLA, advised by Guy Van den Broeck.

I am currently looking for students at all levels. Please email me if you are interested.
