About CraGL

Welcome to the Computational Reality, Creativity and Graphics Lab (CraGL) at George Mason University, led by Dr. Yotam Gingold (bio). Our mission is to solve challenging visual, geometry, and design problems and pursue foundational research into human creativity. We research and teach as part of GMU's Department of Computer Science.

Our work has been supported by the generosity of the National Science Foundation (including CAREER), Adobe, and Google. Our research has been incorporated into Adobe Creative Cloud as Illustrator's Puppet Warp tool.
