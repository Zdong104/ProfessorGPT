Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler


	

-- Albert Einstein

Welcome to my homepage. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before joining Illinois CS, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Martial Hebert. I was a visitor in the Center for Data Science at New York University, working with Prof. Jean Ponce. I obtained my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Martial Hebert in the Robotics Institute. I have also been closely working with Prof. Deva Ramanan and Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov. I receive the Best Paper Honorable Mention Award for streaming perception in ECCV 2020, and Best Paper Award Finalist in CVPR 2019, 2022. I am recognized as a Notable Area Chair in ICLR 2023, and an Expert Reviewer in TMLR.

My research lies in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with a specific focus on open-world AI, meta-learning, few-shot learning, predictive learning, and streaming perception.

I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. / MS students starting Fall 2023. Please feel free to contact me if interested.

Our group also has openings for interns during Spring / Summer 2023. Please feel free to contact me if interested.
