Biography

Yu Xiang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. Before joining UT Dallas, he was a Senior Research Scientist in Robotics at NVIDIA Research from 2018 to 2021. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 2016 advised by Prof. Silvio Savarese. He was a postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Dieter Fox in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington from 2016 to 2017, and was a visiting student researcher in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Stanford University from 2013 to 2016. He received an M.S. degree in Computer Science from Fudan University in 2010 advised by Prof. Xiangdong Zhou, and a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Fudan University in 2007.

Research Interests

My research interests primarily focus on robotics and computer vision. I am interested in studying how can an intelligent system or a robot understand its 3D environment from sensing and accomplish tasks in the real world, which is a very challenging and unsolved problem. Perception serves as an interface between an intelligent system and the 3D world, which provides useful information for planning and control of the system in conducting different tasks. I am interested in integrating perception, planning and control in a systematic way and deploying robots in the real world which are capable of accomplishing tasks for humans. I apply machine learning, especially deep learning, to tackle the challenges in robot perception. I explore how to introduce domain knowledge such as geometric constraints into a deep neural network architecture to learn a useful representation of the 3D environment for perception. I am also interested in how to learn a joint representation for perception, planning and control with deep neural networks, and how to enable robots to learn skills in a self-supervision way by interacting with the 3D environment.
