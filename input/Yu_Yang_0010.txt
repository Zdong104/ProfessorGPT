I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Lehigh University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Rutgers University. My research interests broadly encompass the areas of Cyber-Physical Systems, Spatial-Temporal Data Science, and Human-Centered Computing. Currently, my work focuses on urban sensing, prediction, and decision-making, with diverse applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems, Logistics, On-demand Gig Economy, Last-mile Mobility, and Smart Cities.

I am actively looking for motivated graduate/undergraduate/visiting students to work in my lab. Please email me your CV and all the transcripts if you are interested.
