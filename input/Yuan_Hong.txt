Short Bio

Dr. Yuan Hong is an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at University of Connecticut (UConn) and affiliated with the Connecticut Advanced Computing Center (CACC). Prior to joining UConn in 2022, he was an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Cybersecurity Program Director at Illinois Institute of Technology. He received his Ph.D degree from Rutgers University, M.Sc degree from Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, and B.Sc degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, respectively. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2021), Cisco Research Award (2022, 2023), and the finalist of the Meta Research Award (2021). He also received a National Physics Olympiad Prize in China. He is broadly interested in fundamental research in Security and Privacy (e.g., Differential Privacy, Secure Computation, Applied Cryptography, Adversarial Attacks, Provable Defenses) while intersecting with Cyber-Physical Systems, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Theory. His research works are published in top conferences in Security (S&P, CCS, USENIX Security, NDSS), and Data Science (e.g., SIGMOD, VLDB, CVPR, ECCV, EMNLP, KDD, AAAI), as well as top (interdisciplinary) journals (e.g., multiple IEEE/ACM Trans, T-ITS, TR_C). He is a Senior Member of the ACM and IEEE.

We are always looking for postdocs, Ph.D. students, visiting scholars/students, and undergraduate researchers. Please email your application materials to Dr. Yuan Hong if you are interested in our research.
