Yudong Chen
Associate Professor
Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include machine learning, reinforcement learning, optimization, and high-dimensional statistics. Some of the topics that I am recently interested in are: reinforcement learning theory, non-convex and nonsmooth learning problems, stochastic optimization and approximation. I received an NSF CAREER Award for our work on nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization.

Previously I was a tenured associate professor in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell University. Before that I was a postdoc in the EECS Department at the University of California, Berkeley. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. I received my B.S. and M.S. in Automation from Tsinghua University.

News

In Fall 2024 I am teaching CS 540 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (course page).

My student Matthew Zurek and I posted a new paper, which establishes the optimal sample complexity of average-reward MDP, for both the weakly communicating and multi-chain settings.

Our work on RL with low-rank structure received the Best Student Paper Award from ACM SIGMETRICS 2023. Congratulation to my student Tyler Sam (co-advised with Christina Lee Yu)!

Congratulations to my student Lijun Ding for winning the 2019 Student Paper Prize of INFORMS Optimization Society.

Our work on hidden integrality of SDP relaxation finished 2nd Place in the 2018 INFORMS George Nicholson Student Paper Competition. Congratulations to my student Yingjie (Tom) Fei!
