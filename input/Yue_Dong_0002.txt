Yue Dong
Assistant Professor
University of California, Riverside

Hi, I am Yue (/yoo-eh/) Dong, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California, Riverside. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila, supervised by Dr. Jackie Cheung. I was fortunate to intern at Google AI, AI2, Microsoft, and Noah’s Ark Lab during my PhD.

My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I lead the Natural Language Processing group at UCR, which develops natural language understanding and generation systems that are controllable, trustworthy, and efficient.

Prospective Students (Updated on March, 2024): Thank you for your interest! I have 2 co-advised openings for self-motivated PhD candidates in the field of NLP+RL/theory and NLP+CV/robotics for Winter 2025 or Fall 2024. If you are interested in working with me, please fill out the UCRNLP PhD application form to highlight your potential in ML/NLP research and to assess the alignment with my research interests. Please understand that I will only respond to PhD email inquiries accompanied by a completed form submission due to the large amount of emails.
