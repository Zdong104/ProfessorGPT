About Me



I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.

I am also affiliated with Stevens Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), Center for Research Toward Advancing Financial Technologies (CRAFT), and Semcer Center for Healthcare Innovation (CHI).

My research interests are machine learning, graph mining, and data analytics motivated by real-world problems in social informatics, health informatics, and personalization. Specifically, my research group focuses on developing predictive methods to capture spatio-temporal, dynamic, and interpretable patterns in large-scale data. Our research is sponsored by National Science Foundation, Nvidia, and Stevens.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science of Virginia Tech under Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan.
