“Try to learn something about everything and everything about something.”

—Thomas Henry Huxley (1825 - 1895)

"生而知之者上也，学而知之者次也；困而学之又其次也。困而不学，民斯为下矣."

— Confucius (551 BC - 479 BC)

Bio

Yufei Ding joined the Computer Science & Engineering Department at UCSD in 2023 as an Associate Professor. Before that, Yufei is an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science of UCSB. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University, and B.S. in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China. Her research interests lie in the broad fields of domain-specific language design, architecture and compiler optimization, and hardware acceleration. Her current research focuses on building high-performance, energy-efficient, and high-fidelity programming frameworks for emerging technologies such as quantum computing and machine learning. She is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2020), the IEEE Computer Society TCHPC Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence in High-Performance Computing (2019), NCSU Computer Science Outstanding Dissertation Award (2018), NCSU Computer Science Outstanding Research Award (2016), and Distinguished Paper Award at OOPLSA (2020). Yufei Ding is the founder of PICASSO Lab. Previously, she also co-directs the SEAL lab with Dr. Yuan Xie at UCSB.
