About Me | CV (7/2023)

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and an affiliated member of Center for Visual Science, all at University of Rochester. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin, and previously held visiting researcher positions at Arm Research and Harvard University.

I do research in visual computing, an exciting area spanning imaging (optics and image sensors), human perception and cognition (psychophysics and computational modeling), and computer systems (computer architecture and programming model). My research group page has more to offer.

I am always looking for students. If you love nature, are curious about humans, and happen to know how to program, please read this and send me an email.
