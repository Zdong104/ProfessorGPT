I joined Dartmouth as an Assistant Professor in Jan. 2023. My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning (ML) and network science. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2022, under the supervision of Danai Koutra. My work aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical applications for ML models, especially in the context of complex real-world networks. I am particularly interested in the foundational principles that drive the design of more expressive and generalizable graph-based ML models. Additionally, I explore the practical applications of these models across various domains, including neuroscience and program understanding. 



I am recruiting Ph.D. students and interns. Many motivated interns have the opportunity to produce a paper or submission during their internship.

Please send your CV and transcripts via email if you are interested in working with me. Please apply to our Ph.D. program using this link: Ph.D. in Dartmouth CS.
