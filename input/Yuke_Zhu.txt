I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin and the director of the Robot Perception and Learning (RPL) Lab. I am also a senior research scientist at NVIDIA Research, where I co-lead the Generalist Embodied Agent Research (GEAR) group.

My goal is to build algorithms and systems for autonomous robots and embodied agents that reason about and interact with the real world. My research lies at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and computer vision. I focus on developing methods and principles of perception and decision-making to realize general-purpose robot autonomy in the wild.
