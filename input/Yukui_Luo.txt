I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer & Information Science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Northeastern University under the supervision of Xiaolin Xu.

I’m looking for self-motivated students starting in Spring 2025, with strong research interests in one or more concentrations in security (including both hardware-oriented security and cybersecurity), machine learning, database management system design, operating systems, computer architecture, or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

If you are interested, please read this instruction first.
