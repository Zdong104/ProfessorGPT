Yun S. Song
Professor of Computer Science and Statistics at UC Berkeley.

I work in mathematical and computational biology. I am a core member of the Center for Computational Biology and the UCSF/UC Berkeley Joint Program in Computational Precision Health.

A note on my name: There are only 7 characters in my first and last names combined. Despite this seeming simplicity, a number of people have shown their creativity in misspelling my name. Some examples include "Sun Yong, Yun Sun, Yun Sung, Yung Son, Yon Song, Yun Soon, Jun Song", and just plain "Yum" and "Yup." My first name is Yun, pronounced "Yoon" [ audio ]; please don't spell it that way, though. Also, my middle name is not Song.
