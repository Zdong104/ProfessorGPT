I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), Georgia Institute of Technology since January 2022. I received my PhD in 2021 from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. Jian Peng. Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Yao Class at Tsinghua University in 2016.

I am broadly interested in computational biology and machine learning, with a focus on developing AI and data science methods to reveal core scientific insights into biology and medicine. Recent interests include machine learning, geometric deep learning, generative models, network and system biology, functional genomics, cancer genomics, drug repositioning and discovery, and AI-guided protein engineering.
