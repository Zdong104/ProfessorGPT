I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science in the University of Texas at Dallas. I was a postdoc at UC Berkeley/ICSI working with Prof. Stella Yu. Previously, I completed my PhD at the University of California San Diego advised by Prof. Tajana Rosing. During my PhD, I had the pleasure to spent time at Qualcomm AI research and IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.

Research

My research is at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. The goal of my lab is to investigate, design, and develop intelligent vision systems capable of reliable deployment in real-world scenarios. Currently, my research focuses on constructing intelligent agents that can continuously learn, dynamically adapt to evolving environments without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, and repurpose existing knowledge to adapt to novel scenarios. Our work paves the way for building intelligent and reliable systems in IoT, mobile computing, and autonomous driving, with the long-term goal of making AI more accessible and robust.
