Yunzhu Li

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.

Before joining Columbia, I was an Assistant Professor at UIUC CS. I also spent time as a Postdoc at the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL), working with Fei-Fei Li and Jiajun Wu. I received my PhD from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, where I was advised by Antonio Torralba and Russ Tedrake, and I obtained my bachelor's degree from Peking University.

Robotic Perception, Interaction, and Learning Lab (RoboPIL)
At RoboPIL, we work at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. Specifically, we focus on Robot Learning and aim to significantly expand robots' perception and physical interaction capabilities, particularly through the following three directions.
Intuitive Physics: Learning structured world models for robotic manipulation of objects with diverse physical properties.
Embodied Intelligence: Developing and integrating robotic foundation models for generalizable and long-horizon embodied interactions.
Multi-Modal Perception: Harnessing vision, touch, audio, and language for fine-grained and effective manipulation.
Prospective Students: I'm looking for technically strong and self-motivated students passionate about advancing the frontiers of robot learning.
PhD Applicants: Please submit your application to the CS PhD program, and mention me as one of your Faculty of Interest.
Postdoc and Visiting Students: Please reach out to me directly via email, attaching your CV.
