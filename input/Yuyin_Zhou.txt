I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, Santa Cruz. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University, working closely with Prof. Lei Xing and Prof. Matthew Lungren. I have received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, under the supervision of Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille.

Our group is focusing on advancing biomedical artificial intelligence, primarily in the field of medical image analysis. Our ultimate goal is to match medical experts in decision-making. Specifically, we focus on: 1) creating innovative and cutting-edge medical multimodal model; 2) building real-world learning systems that ensure fair, trustworthy and real-time feedacks to clinicians, caregivers, and even patients; 3) one-shot/few-shot adaptation of open foundation models to diverse medical tasks; 4) synthetic data generation aligned with clinical knowledge.

I am looking for multiple self-motivated PhD/interns to work on machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. Welcome to apply from here and drop me an email with your CV and publications (if any).

Due to the large amount of emails I receive, I may not be able to respond to each one individually.
