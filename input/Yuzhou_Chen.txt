I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Temple University. I am also a Visiting Research Collaborator in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University. Before joining Temple University, I worked as a postdoctoral scholar, advised by H. Vincent Poor, in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Southern Methodist University advised by ‪Hon Keung Tony Ng and Yulia R. Gel.

My research interests are machine learning, deep learning, graph mining, topological data analysis, reliability theory, nonparametric statistics, and their applications. For more details, see my CV.

Recruiting New Students

I am looking for highly motivated and self-driven students NOW, who are interested in machine learning, deep learning on graphs, data mining, and topological and geometric methods in statistics. If you are interested, please contact me at yuzhou.chen@temple.edu. Include your CV and brief highlights of ML/DL/Statistics-related projects.
