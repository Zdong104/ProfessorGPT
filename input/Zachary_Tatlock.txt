My goal is to help students become great computer scientists. In research, I work toward this goal with my students in the UW PLSE research group. In education, I work toward this goal by teaching courses on programming languages and related topics.

My expertise is rooted in formal verification, especially of compilers. As my students develop their own research vision, we branch out across diverse domains. Our work remains unified by themes of making it easier to write tricky code and figuring out how to ensure such programs are correct. We rigorously prove our results while building and measuring real systems1.

My colleague Dan Grossman characterizes this combination of formalism and empiricism as “both Greek and graphs”.↩︎
