I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. My research brings a large-scale, empirical approach to the study of Internet security, trust, and safety. I build systems to measure complex networked ecosystems, and I use the resulting perspective to understand real-world behavior, uncover weaknesses and attacks, architect and deploy more resilient approaches, and guide public policy. I'm also the Co-Founder and Chief Scientist of Censys.

Students and Teaching

I lead the Stanford Empirical Security Research Group where I advise: Hans Hanley, Catherine Han, Kimberly Ruth, Agur Adams (co-advised with Phil Levis), Rumaisa Habib, and Veronica Rivera. Alumni include: Liz Izhikevich, Gerry Wan, Deepak Kumar, Gautam Akiwate, Aurore Fass, Dolière Francis Somé, Fengchen Gong, and Jack Cable.

I teach CS155 Computer and Network Security (2019–2024), CS356 Topics in Systems and Network Security (2018–2023), and CS249i The Modern Internet (2021–2024).
