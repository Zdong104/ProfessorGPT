I‚Äôm Zane, and I study network security and privacy. My research seeks to understand and build systems for authentication and trust on the internet. Current areas of focus include DNS, HTTPS/TLS server authentication, client authentication, and data authenticity. I also analyze the security threats related to emerging network technologies: 5G networks, IoT botnets, cryptocurrency/blockchain abuse, etc.
