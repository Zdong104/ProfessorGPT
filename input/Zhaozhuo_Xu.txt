[Scholar][Github][Stevens Profile]
I am starting as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology in Spring 2024. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University under the supervision of professor Anshumali Shrivastava. My research focuses on scaling up machine learning on commodity hardware using randomized algorithms.
