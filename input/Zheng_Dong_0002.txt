Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science



Drop Me a Message
Welcome!

Dr. Zheng Dong is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department of Wayne State University (WSU), where he is the Co-Director of the CAR Lab, the director of the Real-time Systems Group and the WSU site co-director of NSF IUCRC eCAT Center. He is full of enthusiasm about realizing timing-predictable, safety-critical cyber-physical systems through algorithm-SoC co-design, with autonomous driving being the focused application domain.

Due to his expertise in real-time systems, he is also interested in the development of computer systems with timing-critical components, such as real-time EV fleet charging recommendation systems and edge-enabled smart infrastructures in smart cities.

In August 2019, he earned his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas under the supervision of Dr. Cong Liu.

Previously, he received his Master's degree in computer software engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, and his Bachelor's degree in computer science from Wuhan University.

He is looking for Ph.D. students in the areas of real-time embedded systems, mobile edge computing and autonomous driving. Students with either CS or CE majors are welcome to apply. For current WSU students who are interested in working with him, please stop by his office and see if there is a good match.

The best way to reach him is via Email: dong at wayne.edu
