Dr. Li is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at the University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver). He founds and directs the META (Mobile, Emerging Technologies & Applications) Lab. His research mainly focuses on Internet-of-Things (IoT)/Mobile and Cybersecurity. He has published over 30 research papers on top CS conferences and journals (e.g., MobiCom, MobiSys, SenSys, UbiComp, Oakland, CCS, NDSS, WWW), co-authored one book, and is a named inventor on many international and U.S. patents. He received a Ph.D. degree from the University at Buffalo, SUNY (UB). In addition, he received both an M.S. degree and a B.S. degree from Hangzhou Dianzi University (HDU) (both with honor), China.

The broad interest of META Lab is to serve the transformation towards intelligent society by exploring the physical & cyber worlds integration and secure technologies.

Dr. Li is the advisor of the Women in Computer Science Organization in the CSE Department.

Dr. Li is on the committee at the Denver Science Fair for K-12 education outreach.
