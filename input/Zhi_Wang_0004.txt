I am an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Florida State University. I have broad research interests in security with a focus on the systems security, particularly, operating systems / virtualization security, software security, and mobile security (Google Scholar). I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER award (2015) and FSU Developing Scholar Award (2019).

Attention: if you are teaching a course that uses UNIX-like CLI environment, please take a look at WiTTY

WiTTY is a web-based terminal emulator that allows students to record, share, and replay interactive console sessions with just a few clicks. With this tool, students can send the instructors recorded sessions, instead of ambigious descriptions of their problems. Drop me a line if you find it useful. We would love to hear about it.

Here is the document for WiTTY https://syssecfsu.github.io/witty/
