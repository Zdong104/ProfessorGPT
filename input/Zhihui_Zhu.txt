Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University. Prior to joining OSU,  I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Denver from 2020-2022 and a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Mathematical Institute for Data Science, Johns Hopkins University, from 2018 to 2019. I received my Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 2017 from the Colorado School of Mines, where my research was awarded a Graduate Research Award.

Our group works on theoretical and computational aspects of data science and machine learning, with a focus on developing efficient methods for extracting useful information from large-scale and high-dimensional data, proving their correctness, and applying them to solving real-world problems in computational imaging, quantum information, etc.
