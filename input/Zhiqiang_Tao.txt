Brief Bio

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Information at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Prior to joining RIT, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Santa Clara University from 2020 to 2022. I received my Ph.D. degree from the ECE Department at Northeastern University, under the supervision of Prof. Yun Raymond Fu. I obtained my B.E. and M.E. degrees from Tianjin University in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

I am looking for highly-motivated graduate (Ph.D./Master) students to work with me. Please drop me an email if interested.
