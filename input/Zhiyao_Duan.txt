AIR Lab Is Recruiting

I am looking for strongly motivated PhD students to work with me in the Audio Information Research (AIR) lab on cool computer audition projects. Students are expected to have a solid background in mathematics, programming, and academic writing. Experiences in music activities will be a plus. If you are interested, please apply through the ECE program at the university's admission website, and mention my name in your personal statement. If you apply through the CS program, please remind me through email, as I do not review all CS applications. If you are in the Rochester area, please feel free to stop by my office for a chat.

If you are a master's or undergrad student who wants to do a project/thesis with me, you are welcome too. Please send me an email or stop by my office.

Brief Bio

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Rochester since July 2013. I also hold a secondary appointment in the Department of Computer Science and am affiliated faculty of the Goergen Institute for Data Science.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Northwestern University under the supervision of Prof. Bryan Pardo. I received my bachelor and master's degrees from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University in 2004 and 2008, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. Changshui Zhang.

I was a visiting researcher in the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University in 2007, and in the Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory at the Ohio State University in 2013. I interned in the Speech group of Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) in 2007 and 2008, and in the Advanced Technology Labs of Adobe Systems Inc. in 2011.

Research Interests

My research interests lie primarily in the emerging area of Computer Audition, which is about designing intelligent algorithms and systems that can understand sounds, including music, speech and environmental sounds. This is an interdisciplinary area that draws from many fields including signal processing, machine learning, psychoacoustics, music theory, etc. Specific problems that I have been working on include automatic music transcription, sound source separation, audio-score alignment, music annotation and recommendation, speech enhancement and emotion analysis, sound retrieval, and audio-visual analysis of music performances.

Our work is funded by the National Science Foundation under grants No. 1617107, titled "III: Small: Collaborative Research: Algorithms for Query by Example of Audio Databases" (project website), No. 1741472, titled "BIGDATA: F: Audio-Visual Scene Understanding" (project website), and No. 1846174, titled "CAREER: Human-Computer Collaborative Music Making". Our work is also funded by the University of Rochester internal pilot awards on AR/VR and health analytics.
