	Zhiyun Qian is the Everett and Imogene Ross professor in Computer Science and Engineering department at University of California Riverside.

He has a broad interest in system/network security, with the general theme of vulnerability discovery and analysis, system building, and measurement. He has a well-rounded understanding of computer systems including operating systems, software, network protocols, architecture, and their interactions. The techniques he applies include program analysis, reverse engineering, fuzzing, model checking, and AI / machine learning. More recently he is most passionate about building impactful systems and tools.

Besides research, he has also successfully competed with his students in various hacking competitions such as Pwn2Own and GeekPwn.


To prospective students:  I'm looking for students with a strong interest in security. Experiences in hacking, CTF, program analysis, testing, or machine learning/AI would be advantageous. If you are interested, feel free to drop me an email and introduce yourself!
