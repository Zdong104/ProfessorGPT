Bio

Zhu Li (Bio, CV) is now a professor with the Dept of Computer Science & Electrical Engnieering (CSEE), University of Missouri,Kansas City, and the director of the NSF Center for Big Learning at UMKC . He was an AFRL summer visiting professor at the US Air Force Academy , Colorado Springs, Summer of 2016-18, 2020, and 2022. He received his PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Northwestern University, Evanston in 2004. He was Sr. Staff Researcher/Sr. Manager with with Samsung Research America's Multimedia Standards Research Lab in Richardson, TX, 2012-2015, Sr. Staff Researcher/Media Analytics Group Lead with FutureWei (Huawei) Technology's Media Lab in Bridgewater, NJ, 2010~2012, and an Assistant Professor with the Dept of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University from 2008 to 2010, and a Principal Staff Research Engineer with the Multimedia Research Lab (MRL), Motorola Labs, from 2000 to 2008.

His research interests include image/video, light field and point cloud compression, deep learning based compression schemes, remote sensing and vision, image/video denoising and super-resolution, video hashing and identification, as well as the video communication system issues like joint source-channel coding, rate-distortion optimization and communication resource management. He has 50 issued or pending patents, 200+ publications in book chapters, journals, conference proceedings and standard contributions in these areas. He is an IEEE senior member, Associate Editor-in-Chief (AEiC) for IEEE Trans on Circuits & System for Video Technology, Associate Editor (2020~) for IEEE Trans on Image Processing , associated editor for IEEE Trans.on Multimedia, 2016-19,for IEEE Trans on Circuits & System for Video Technology, 2015-18, for Journal of Signal Processing Systems (Springer), 2015~present, steering committee memeber of IEEE ICME, elected member (2014-2017) of the IEEE Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP) Tech Committee, elected Vice Chair (2008-2010), Standards Liaison (2014-2016) of the IEEE Multimedia Communication Technical Committee (MMTC), member of the Best Paper Award Committee, ICME 2010, co-editor for the Springer-Verlag book on "Intelligent Video Communication: Techniques and Applications", and " Multimedia Analysis, Computing and Communication,". He received a Best Paper Runner-up Award at the Perception Beyond Visual Spectrum (PBVS) challenge at CVPR 2023, the Best Poster Paper Award at IEEE Int'l Conf on Multimedia & Expo (ICME), Toronto, 2006, and the Best Paper (DoCoMo Labs Innovative Paper) Award at IEEE Int'l Conf on Image Processing (ICIP), San Antonio, 2007.
