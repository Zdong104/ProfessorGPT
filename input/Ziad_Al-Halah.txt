Welcome

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. Before that, I was Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, working with Prof. Kristen Grauman in the Computer Vision Group. I was a resident researcher with the Artificial Intelligence group at NAVER in South Korea, and a visiting researcher with the Coretx / Computer Vision group at Twitter in the UK and with the Vision group at Disney Research in Pittsburgh. I received my PhD with distinction (summa cum laude) from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, working in the Computer Vision for Human Computer Interaction Laboratory.

My research interests are in the areas of computer vision and artificial intelligence. I'm particularly interested in transfer learning, zero-shot learning, multimodal learning, and embodied AI.
