I am a postdoc at DIMACS, Rutgers University. I obtained my PhD from University of Chicago, where I was advised by Prof. Julia Chuzhoy. You can find my CV here (last updated: Apr 2024).


My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, and more specifically graph algorithms. My research focuses on developing modern algorithms for processing massive graphs, especially from the following three aspects: 
(i) exploring the limit of graph compression;
(ii) studying graph problems in modern computational models (e.g. sublinear, dynamic, 			distributed); and 
(iii) designing approximation algorithms for fundamental graph problems by exploring the 	interplay between structural graph theory and graph algorithms.
I co-organized the DIMACS Workshop on Modern Techniques in Graph Algorithms in June 2023 (with Nicole Wein and Prantar Ghosh). Check out the list of videos here.
