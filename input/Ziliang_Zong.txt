I am a Professor of the Computer Science Department. I received the Distinguished Ph.D. Dissertation Award from Auburn University (2008), Texas State University Presidential Award for Excellence in Scholarly/Creative Activities (2015), and the Texas State University Presidential Distinction Award for Excellence in Scholarly/Creative Activities (2020). I am a general member of the Green Software Foundation and an assiciate editor of Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems (SUSCOM).

My research focuses on Energy-Efficient Computing and Systems, including Green Software Design, Green AI, Green Cloud, Green Data Center, and Edge Computing. We welcome qualified and self-motivated students to join our group.

Congratulations
Congratulations for Stuart, Sarah, Andi, Jonathan, Sang, Divya, Keshav, and Cody received job offers from Google, Intel, Apple, Amazon, LinkedIn, Dell, Tesla, and Databricks!
