About the PI
Hi, my name is Zining Zhu (朱子宁). I am an Assistant Professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology. I received Ph.D. degree at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute, advised by Frank Rudzicz. I direct the Explainable and Controllable AI lab. I'm also affiliated with the Stevens Institute for Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in understanding the mechanisms and abilities of neural network AI systems, and incorporating the findings into controlling the AI systems. In the long term, I look forward to empowering real-world applications with safe and trustworthy AIs that can collaborate with humans.

	

I’m looking for multiple PhD/master/internship students to work on explainable and safe NLP AI systems. If you are interested in working on these directions, please send me an email at zzhu41@stevens.edu.
