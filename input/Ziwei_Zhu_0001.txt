Howdy! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University. I got my Ph.D. from the Computer Science & Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, advised by Prof. James Caverlee. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University.

I am broadly interested in data mining, machine learning, and information retrieval, with a special emphasis on augmenting responsibility in machine learning to provide fair, unbiased, accountable, and trustworthy information services for both end users and society-at-large.

I am looking for multiple PhD students. If you are interested, please contact me.

For Prospective Students

For prospective PhD students: I am looking for highly self-motivated PhD students with funding support. If you are interested in working with me, please email me with your CV, transcript, a description of your research interests and experience, and your writting samples (e.g., publications, dissertations, project reports, and so on). Please start your email subject with "[Prospective PhD Student - ${Your_Application_Semester}]".
