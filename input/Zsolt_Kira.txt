About Me

I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Interactive Computing in the College of Computing, and serve as an Associate Director of ML@GT which is the machine learning center recently created at Georgia Tech. Previously I was a Branch Chief at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) and Research Scientist at SRI International Sarnoff in Princeton. I received my Ph.D. in 2010 with Professor Ron Arkin as my advisor.

I lead the RobotIcs Perception and Learning (RIPL) lab. My areas of research specifically focus on the intersection of learning methods for sensor processing and robotics, developing novel machine learning algorithms and formulations towards solving some of the more difficult perception problems in these areas. I am especially interested in moving beyond supervised learning (un/semi/self-supervised and continual/lifelong learning) as well as distributed perception (multi-modal fusion, learning to incorporate information across a group of robots, etc.).
