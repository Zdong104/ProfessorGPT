Akos Ledeczi

Professor of Computer Science

Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

My two main research areas are computer science education and wireless sensor networks (WSN). NetsBlox, our open source, web-based visual programming environment for K12 supports synergistic learning of STEM and Computational Thinking. I co-authored a highly popular introductory programming MOOC available on Coursera. In the WSN domain, my team has developed a novel WSN-based countersniper system. An enhanced version is soldier wearable and not only does it localize the shooter very accurately, but it can also tell the caliber and the weapon type. An interesting paper describes the system in detail. 

My other focus is Model Integrated Computing. Our latest open source software tool, the Web-based Generic Modeling Environment is a web- and cloud-based, collaborative, configurable toolkit for creating domain-specific visual modeling and program synthesis environments.
